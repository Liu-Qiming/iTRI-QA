The study was to investigate the association of weight range with telomere length. METHODS: Data of 2918 eligible participants aged 25-84 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000 cycle were analyzed. Information about demographic variables, lifestyle factors, anthropometric variables, and medical comorbidities were included. Univariate and multivariate linear regression model with adjustments for potential confounders were employed to determine the association between weight range and telomere length. A non-parametrically restricted cubic spline model was used to illustrate the possible non-linear relationship. RESULTS: In univariate linear regression, BMI(max), BMI range, and weight range all revealed significant negative associations with telomere length. However, annual rate of BMI/weight range showed a significant positive associations with telomere length. There was no significant association between telomere length and BMI(min). After adjusting for potential confounders, the inverse associations persisted in BMI(max) (\u03b2=-0.003, P{\\textless}0.001), BMI range (\u03b2=-0.002, P=0.003), and weight range (\u03b2=-0.001, P=0.001).

This study aims to investigate the associations between LTL and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: All participants with baseline LTL records were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. Death status and its causes were ascertained for National Death Index based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code. Cox proportional hazards regression models were established to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of LTL associating with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

METHODS: A cohort of 6862 adults with LTL measurements and with or without T2D from the NHANES 1999-2002 with follow-up information until 2015 was studied. Quantitative PCR was used to measure the length of telomeres relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Individuals were grouped into three tertiles according to the LTL levels, with the first tertile demonstrating the lowest one and used as the reference group. The effects of LTL and T2D status on death were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves along with log-rank test. Three Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for various confounders were used to examine the links between TL and all-cause death possibility using adjusted hazard ratios (HRs).

Conversely, the individuals with T2D had a higher probability of death than individuals without (aHR = 1.26; 95\\%CI: 1.06-1.50; P = 0.0092). When LTL and T2D status were investigated jointly, subjects in the highest TLT tertile and with T2D had the highest probability of mortality compared with their counterparts (aHR = 1.34; 95\\%CI: 1.07-1.68; P = 0.0101).

Recently, the visceral adiposity index (VAI) has been proposed as an indicator of adipose distribution and function. OBJECTIVE: To evaluated the association between VAI and LTL in adult Americans. METHODS: There were 3193 participants in U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999-2002) included in this analysis. LTL was measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and expressed as telomere to single-gene copy ratio (T/S ratio). We performed multiple logistic regression models to explore the association between VAI and LTL by adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among all participants, VAI was associated with the shorter LTL (\u03b2: - 14.81, 95\\% CI - 22.28 to - 7.34, p {\\textless} 0.001).

HOMA-Index was calculated as fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) \u00d7 fasting serum insulin (mU/mL)/22.5. LTL was obtained using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Multivariate linear regression analysis was assessed to evaluate the association of TyG index HOMA-IR with LTL. We further conducted a generalized additive model (GAM) and a fitted smoothing curve with penalized spline method. RESULTS: It was found that the mean LTL was 5796.1 bp in the measured healthy adults. Overall, TyG index was significantly associated with LTL, while HOMA-IR was not. Compared with participants in tertile 1 of the TyG index, the \u03b2 (95\\% CI) for those in the second (8.27 to 8.77) and third (\u2265 8.77) were -4.31 (95\\% CI: -48.12{\\textasciitilde}39.49) and -95.98 (95\\% CI: -145.08{\\textasciitilde}-46.89), respectively. Subjects with TyG index \u2265 8.77 had statistically significant shorter LTL (\u03b2 = -93.33, 95\\%CI: -134.33{\\textasciitilde}-52.32), compared with TyG index {\\textless} 8.77. We further explored a dose-response relation between TyG index by a decile approach [\u2264 7.81 (reference), 7.81-8.04, 8.04-8.21, 8.21-8.37, 8.37-8.52, 8.52-8.68, 8.68-8.83, 8.83-9.03, 9.03-9.33, and {\\textgreater}9.33] and LTL. Five subgroups (TyG index 7.81-8.04, 8.04-8.21, 8.21-8.37, 8.37-8.52, and 8.52-8.68) did not show significant effect on LTL; while there was a significantly shorter LTL for participants with the TyG index {\\textgreater} 8.68, supporting a threshold effect of TyG index on LTL. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that higher TyG index ({\\textgreater} 8.68) was closely related to shorter LTL and the TyG index was better associated with LTL than HOMA-IR."}

Copper is widely viewed as one of the essential elements in the diet. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between telomere length and dietary copper intake in hypertension and provide a basis for guiding dietary copper intake in patients with hypertension. METHODS: The data was collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. The relevance between telomere length and dietary copper intake in hypertension is assessed using a multivariable linear regression model. RESULTS: We gathered 1,867 participants with hypertension with assessed telomere length and dietary copper intake. We found that one unit increasing log-transformed dietary copper intake in hypertension was significantly associated with longer telomere length base pair (bp) (\u03b2 = 112.20, 95\\% confidence interval [CI]: 5.48, 218.92), after controlling for covariates, including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and taking medication for hypertension.

We sought to examine the association of telomere length (TL) with liver disease and its impact on mortality risk. A cohort of 7,072 adults with leukocyte TL measurements from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 with mortality follow-up through 2015 was analyzed. Liver disease was defined by aminotransferase levels and classified into etiology-based and advanced fibrosis categories. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated effect sizes, with 95\\% confidence intervals (CIs), of the presence of liver disease on TL. Cox regression models evaluated associations between TL and all-cause mortality risk using adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). The cohort was representative of the US population with mean age 46.1 years and mean TL 5.79 kilobase pairs. No overall association between TL and liver disease was found; however, there was a significant negative association of TL and advanced liver fibrosis in individuals aged 65 and above. The liver disease cohort (HR 1.22, 95\\% CI 0.99-1.51) and those with metabolic syndrome (HR 1.26, 95\\% CI 0.96-1.67) had increased mortality risk with shorter TL. The relationship between TL and all-cause mortality was stronger in women (HR 1.51, 95\\% CI 1.02-2.23) and in non-Hispanic Whites (HR 1.37, 95\\% CI 1.02-1.84). Conclusion: Shortened leukocyte TL is independently associated with advanced liver disease at older ages, and with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in those with liver disease. These associations reaffirm the need to better understand the role of telomeres in the progression of liver disease."}

{"question": "What is the association between endometriosis and telomere length? ", "answer": "Women with endometriosis had a shorter telomere length than women without endometriosis (-3.4, 95% CI: -7.3 to -0.3 in age-adjusted models and -2.9, 95% CI: -8.8 to 3.5 in fully adjusted models)", "pmid": "34449264", "doi": "10.1089/jwh.2021.0044", "category": "knowledge", "abstract": "Background: Recent studies have suggested a link between reproductive health and later-life chronic conditions, yet the mechanism remains unclear. One proposed mechanism is through chronic inflammation. The objective of this study was to examine the association between endometriosis and uterine fibroids and biomarkers of inflammation and cellular aging. Materials and Methods: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2342; 1999-2002). Adjusted logistic and linear regression were used to examine the association between these two reproductive conditions and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; {\\textgreater}3.0 mg/L) and leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio), respectively. Given that a greater length of time spent with a condition may represent persistence of an inflammatory process, we further examined the association between time since disease diagnosis on telomere length among the subset of women with diagnosed endometriosis and fibroids. Results: Women with endometriosis had greater odds of having elevated CRP than those without endometriosis (OR = 1.60; 95\\% CI: 1.05 to 2.45). Women with endometriosis had a shorter telomere length than women without endometriosis (-3.4, 95\\% CI: -7.3 to -0.3 in age-adjusted models and -2.9, 95\\% CI: -8.8 to 3.5 in fully adjusted models). Telomeres were 1\\% (95\\% CI: -1.2 to -0.6) shorter for every elapsed year since endometriosis diagnosis. No substantive patterns emerged between uterine fibroids and CRP or telomere length. Conclusions: Women with endometriosis (or a longer duration of time spent with endometriosis) had higher inflammatory markers and shorter mean telomere length. These results provide further insights into potential mechanisms linking endometriosis to chronic disease and later-life health."}
{"question": "What is the association between weight changes and telomere length?", "answer": "People with stable obesity had shorter leukocyte telomere length than those with stable normal weight, while weight gain from non-obesity to obesity shortened the leukocyte telomere length.", "pmid": "34393992", "doi": "10.3389/fendo.2021.650988", "category": "knowledge", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of dynamic weight change in adulthood with leukocyte telomere length among U.S. adults. METHODS: This study included 3,886 subjects aged 36-75 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 cycle. Survey-weighted multivariable linear regression with adjustments for potential confounders was utilized. RESULTS: 3,386 individuals were finally included. People with stable obesity had a 0.130 kbp (95\\% CI: 0.061-0.198, P=1.97E-04) shorter leukocyte telomere length than those with stable normal weight (reference group) during the 10-year period, corresponding to approximately 8.7 years of aging. Weight gain from non-obesity to obesity shortened the leukocyte telomere length by 0.094 kbp (95\\% CI: 0.012-0.177, P=0.026), while normal weight to overweight or remaining overweight shortened the leukocyte telomere length by 0.074 kbp (95\\% CI: 0.014-0.134, P=0.016). The leukocyte telomere length has 0.003 kbp attrition on average for every 1 kg increase in weight from a mean age of 41 years to 51 years. Further stratified analysis showed that the associations generally varied across sex and race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that weight changes during a 10-year period was associated with leukocyte telomere length and supports the theory that weight gain promotes aging across adulthood."}

Fruit and vegetable (F\\&V) consumption was assessed using a 24 h recall, and telomere length, an index of cellular aging, was measured using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Telomere length was linearly related to F\\&V intake when combined (F = 22.7, p {\\textless} 0.0001) and also when separated as fruit (F = 7.2, p {\\textless} 0.0121) or vegetables (F = 15.4, p {\\textless} 0.0005), after adjusting for covariates. Specifically, telomeres were 27.8 base pairs longer for each 100 g (3.5 ounces) of F\\&V consumed. Because each additional year of chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 14.9 base pairs shorter, when women and men were analyzed together, results indicated that a 100 g (3.5 oz) per day increment in F\\&V corresponded with 1.9 years less biological aging. When the 75th percentile of F\\&V intake was compared to the 25th, the difference was 4.4 years of cellular aging. When separated by sex, fruits and vegetables were both related to telomere length in women, but only vegetable intake was predictive of telomere length in men. In conclusion, evidence based on a random sample of U.S. adults indicates that the more the servings of F\\&V, the longer telomeres tend to be."}
