{"question": "What is the association of telomere length with risk of mortality from influenza and pneumonia?", "answer": "shorter TL was associated with higher influenza-pneumonia mortality", "pmid": "37962763"}
{"question": "How do the associations between telomere length and influenza-pneumonia mortality differ by sex?", "answer": "Men exhibited stronger associations with influenza-pneumonia mortality than women across all models. For example, in Model 1, the hazard ratio (HR) for men was 0.014 compared to 0.054 for women.", "pmid": "37962763"}
{"question": "What is the relationship between greenspace exposure and telomere length?", "answer": "Greater greenspace exposure in one's neighborhood was associated with longer telomere lengths ", "pmid": "37777139"}
{"question": "Did the relationship between greenspace and telomere length remain significant after adjusting for contextual factors?", "answer": "No, the relationship became non-significant when contextual factors, such as air pollution and deprivation, were included in the analysis.", "pmid": "37777139"}
{"question": "How is telomere length (TL) related to bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC)", "answer": " TL positively correlated with BMD and BMC in most body parts, but showed a negative correlation in the upper limbs and skull.", "pmid": "37744360"}
{"question": "What is the relationship between telomere length and fat/muscle content?", "answer": "Fat content was negatively associated with TL, while muscle content was positively linked to TL.", "pmid": "37744360"}
