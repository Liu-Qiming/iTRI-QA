{"question": "What is the association of telomere length with risk of mortality from influenza and pneumonia?", "answer": "shorter TL was associated with higher influenza-pneumonia mortality", "pmid": "37962763"}
{"question": "How do the associations between telomere length and influenza-pneumonia mortality differ by sex?", "answer": "Men exhibited stronger associations with influenza-pneumonia mortality than women across all models. For example, in Model 1, the hazard ratio (HR) for men was 0.014 compared to 0.054 for women.", "pmid": "37962763"}
{"question": "What is the relationship between greenspace exposure and telomere length?", "answer": "Greater greenspace exposure in one's neighborhood was associated with longer telomere lengths ", "pmid": "37777139"}
{"question": "Did the relationship between greenspace and telomere length remain significant after adjusting for contextual factors?", "answer": "No, the relationship became non-significant when contextual factors, such as air pollution and deprivation, were included in the analysis.", "pmid": "37777139"}
{"question": "How is telomere length (TL) related to bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC)", "answer": " TL positively correlated with BMD and BMC in most body parts, but showed a negative correlation in the upper limbs and skull.", "pmid": "37744360"}
{"question": "What is the relationship between telomere length and fat/muscle content?", "answer": "Fat content was negatively associated with TL, while muscle content was positively linked to TL.", "pmid": "37744360"}
{"question": "How did telomere length (TL) mediate the relationship between pollutant exposure and metabolic syndrome (MetS)?", "answer": "Principal component analysis showed that TL explained 26.1% of the effect of PC2 and 17.1% of PC4 on MetS risk in males, and 17.7% of the effect of PC2 on MetS in females.", "pmid": "37322399"}
{"question": "What model can be used to assess the relationship between exposure to a mixture of  environmental chemicals and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and further examined  whether telomere length (TL) moderated these relationships?", "answer": "The correlations between  multi-pollutant exposure, TL, and MetS in the males and females were separately  assessed using principal component analysis (PCA), logistic and extended linear  regression models, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and mediation  analysis.", "pmid": "37322399"}
{"question": "What is the association between mixed exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and telomere length in the adult general population?", "answer": "The  mixed exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is negatively associated with telomere length in the adult general population.", "pmid": "37160859"}
{"question": "How to analyze these associations of  telomere length in multiple PAH-exposed environments?", "answer": "Bayesian nuclear  machine regression (BKMR) was conducted to analyze these associations of  telomere length in multiple PAH-exposed environments. Linear regression is  mainly used for correlation analysis of PAHs with selected covariate  adjustments. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) is used to estimate the correlation  between selected PAHs and telomere length", "pmid": "37160859"}
{"question": "What is the association of weight range with telomere length?", "answer": "In univariate linear regression, BMImax, BMI range, and weight range  all revealed significant negative associations with telomere length. However,  annual rate of BMI/weight range showed a significant positive associations with  telomere length.", "pmid": "37113487"}
{"question": "What is the association between leukocyte telomere length and cardiovascular mortality in type 2  diabetes patients?", "answer": "Longer LTL was  associated with reduced all-cause mortality, whereas this association  disappeared after adjusting for other variables. ", "pmid": "36890680"}
{"question": "What's the association between dietary vitamin C and telomere length?", "answer": "This cross-sectional study showed that vitamin C was positively  correlated with telomere length, with greater dietary vitamin C intake  associated with longer telomeres (\u03b2 = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.05, P = 0.003).", "pmid": "36776610"}
