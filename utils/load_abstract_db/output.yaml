- abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Even though cadmium (Cd) exposure and cellular senescence
    (telomere length) have been linked in previous studies, composite molecular aging
    biomarkers are more significant and reliable factors to consider when examining
    the connection between metal exposure and health outcomes. The purpose of this
    research was to assess the association between urinary cadmium (U-Cd) and whole-body
    aging (phenotypic age). METHODS: Phenotypic age was calculated from chronological
    age and 9 molecular biomarkers. Multivariate linear regression models, subgroup
    analysis, and smoothing curve fitting were used to explore the linear and nonlinear
    relationship between U-Cd and phenotypic age. Mediation analysis was performed
    to explore the mediating effect of U-Cd on the association between smoking and
    phenotypic age. RESULTS: This study included 10,083 participants with a mean chronological
    age and a mean phenotypic age of 42.24 years and 42.34 years, respectively. In
    the fully adjusted model, there was a positive relationship between U-Cd and phenotypic
    age [2.13 years per 1 ng/g U-Cd, (1.67, 2.58)]. This association differed by sex,
    age, and smoking subgroups (P for interaction {\textless} 0.05). U-Cd mediated
    a positive association between serum cotinine and phenotypic age, mediating a
    proportion of 23.2\%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that high levels of Cd
    exposure are associated with whole-body aging.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a worldwide public health concern,
    mainly afflicting older adults. Although the etiology of OA remains unclear, environmental
    factors are increasingly considered as non-negligible risk factors. This study
    aims to evaluate the associations of urinary metals with OA risk and the mediated
    effect of biological aging. METHODS: Nine urinary metal concentrations were detected
    among 12,584 U.S. adults based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES), including barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), cesium (Cs),
    molybdenum (Mo), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), thallium (Tl), and uranium (Tu). Multivariable
    logistic regression and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression were used to explore
    the associations of single metal and mixed metals with OA risk, respectively.
    Furthermore, biological aging was measured from different perspectives, including
    cell senescence (telomere length) and whole-body aging (phenotypic age and biological
    age). Mediation analyses were conducted to investigate the mediated effects of
    aging on the associations of metals with OA risk. RESULTS: In the single-exposure
    model, Cd, Co, and Cs were identified to be positively associated with OA risk,
    with odds ratios (OR) ranging from 1.48 to 1.64 (all P {\textless} 0.05). Mixed-exposure
    analyses showed consistent associations (OR 1.23, 95\%CI 1.10 to 1.37) and highlighted
    that Cd, Co, and Cs were responsible for the outcomes. Additionally, Cd, Co, Cs,
    Pb, and Tl were positively associated with biological aging markers, while all
    biological aging markers had significant associations with OA risk. Further mediation
    analyses showed that the associations of single metal (mainly Cd and Cs) and mixed
    metals with OA risk parallelly mediated by the above biological aging markers,
    with the proportion of mediation ranging from 16.89 to 69.39\% (all P {\textless}
    0.05). Moreover, such associations were also serially mediated through telomere
    length-biological age path and telomere length-phenotypic age path (the proportion
    of mediation: 4.17-11.67\%), indicating that metals accelerated cell senescence
    to lead to whole-body aging and finally aggravated OA progress. CONCLUSIONS: These
    findings suggested that exposure to metals increased OA risk, which was possibly
    and partly mediated by biological aging.'

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an important biomarker of
    aging. The oxidative balance score (OBS) is used to assess the oxidative stress-related
    exposures of diet and lifestyle. This study is aimed at exploring if the OBS was
    associated with LTL. METHODS: 3220 adults were included in this study from the
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. LTL was assayed
    from leukocyte DNA. Twenty dietary and lifestyle factors were selected to score
    the OBS. Survey-based multivariable linear regression was conducted to assess
    the association between the OBS and log-transformed LTL. RESULTS: The association
    between the OBS and log-transformed LTL was positive in females but not males.
    For females, compared with the lowest OBS category as a reference, the multivariable-adjusted
    beta estimate (95\% confidence interval, CI) for the highest OBS category was
    0.0701 (0.0205-0.1197) (p for trend {\textless} 0.01), and the multivariable-adjusted
    beta estimate (95\% CI) of the continuous OBS was 0.0039 (0.0014-0.0065). There
    was also the gender difference in the correlations of the dietary OBS and the
    lifestyle OBS with log-transformed LTL. CONCLUSION: There was a positive association
    between the OBS and LTL in females. This result suggested that diet and lifestyle
    might affect LTL by regulating oxidative balance.'

- abstract: 'Physiologic aging leads to attrition of telomeres and replicative senescence.
    An acceleration of this process has been hypothesized in the progression of chronic
    liver disease. We sought to examine the association of telomere length (TL) with
    liver disease and its impact on mortality risk. A cohort of 7,072 adults with
    leukocyte TL measurements from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    1999-2002 with mortality follow-up through 2015 was analyzed. Liver disease was
    defined by aminotransferase levels and classified into etiology-based and advanced
    fibrosis categories. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated
    effect sizes, with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), of the presence of liver disease
    on TL. Cox regression models evaluated associations between TL and all-cause mortality
    risk using adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). The cohort was representative of the
    US population with mean age 46.1 years and mean TL 5.79 kilobase pairs. No overall
    association between TL and liver disease was found; however, there was a significant
    negative association of TL and advanced liver fibrosis in individuals aged 65
    and above. The liver disease cohort (HR 1.22, 95\% CI 0.99-1.51) and those with
    metabolic syndrome (HR 1.26, 95\% CI 0.96-1.67) had increased mortality risk with
    shorter TL. The relationship between TL and all-cause mortality was stronger in
    women (HR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.02-2.23) and in non-Hispanic Whites (HR 1.37, 95\% CI
    1.02-1.84). Conclusion: Shortened leukocyte TL is independently associated with
    advanced liver disease at older ages, and with a higher risk of all-cause mortality
    in those with liver disease. These associations reaffirm the need to better understand
    the role of telomeres in the progression of liver disease.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL)
    and mortality risk in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains poorly
    understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between telomere length
    and long-term all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality,
    in individuals with MetS in the United States. METHODS: A total of 1980 participants
    with MetS aged 18 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES) prospective cohort study (1999-2002) were included in this cohort
    study. Medical records review was used to identify the cause of deaths as of December
    2018. We employed Kaplan-Meier curves, fitted curves, and Cox proportional hazards
    regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and CVD mortality,
    stratified by tertiles of LTL. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 17.75 years
    of participants with metabolic syndrome, 819 deaths occurred, including 231 cardiovascular
    deaths. After adjusting for multiple covariates, participants with shorter telomere
    length had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.33; 95\%
    CI, 1.11-1.6) and CVD mortality (HR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.93) compared with those
    in the highest tertile of telomere length. All-cause mortality (P {\textless}
    0.001) and cardiovascular disease mortality (P = 0.028) followed a similar pattern
    across tertiles of telomere length. CONCLUSION: In individuals with MetS, shorter
    telomere length is associated with increased risks of death from cardiovascular
    disease and all causes. The underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of
    these findings require additional investigation.'

- abstract: 'Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is characterised by the concurrent presence of
    sarcopenia and excess adiposity. Telomere shortening has been associated with
    sarcopenia and obesity alone but the association between SO and telomere length
    (TL) has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate SO and TL in an
    adult population. Data were from 5397 individuals (mean age = 44.7 years, 51.3\%
    male) enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Body composition
    (BC) was assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Two models were used to
    assess SO: a BC model including four phenotypes derived from the combination of
    high or low adiposity and muscle mass; and, a truncal fat mass to appendicular
    skeletal mass ratio (TrFM/ASM). TL was assessed using quantitative polymerase
    chain reaction and expressed as base pairs. The mean TL, relative to the reference
    DNA, was calculated and expressed as the mean T/S ratio. A General Linear Model
    was applied to determine associations between TL for SO. In adjusted analysis,
    only individuals with SO, defined as the presence of high adiposity-low muscle
    mass (four-phenotype model), had significantly shorter telomeres (p = 0.05) than
    the reference group (i.e. low adiposity-high muscle mass), with a mean T/S ratio
    of 1.02 (95\%CI: 0.98-1.05) compared to 1.05 (95\%CI: 1.01-1.09), respectively.
    TrFM/ASM was not associated with TL. Preliminary findings suggest that sarcopenia
    and obesity may act synergistically to shorten telomeres.'

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: There has been an association between changes in body composition,
    fracture incidence, and age in previous studies. Telomere length (TL) has been
    proposed as a biomarker of aging. However, the relationship between body composition,
    fractures, and TL has rarely been studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate
    the correlation between TL and body composition and fractures.Patients and methods:
    20950 participants from the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES) were included in the final analysis. In NHANES, body compositions
    were measured with DXA, and TL was determined with quantitative PCR. Correlation
    analysis of TL and body composition was conducted using multivariate weighted
    linear regression and logistic regression models. RESULTS: The results showed
    that TL positively correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral
    content (BMC) in most body parts. However, BMD and BMC were negatively connected
    with TL in the upper limbs and skull. Fat content was negatively associated with
    TL, while muscle content was positively linked to TL. In addition, TL''s trend
    analysis results were consistent with the regression model when transformed from
    a continuous to a classified variable. An increase in TL was associated with a
    higher incidence of wrist fractures, while a decrease in spine fractures. The
    above correlation also has a certain degree of sex specificity. CONCLUSION: Our
    study indicate that TL is associated with body composition as well as fractures,
    but further research is needed to confirm these contrasting associations in the
    skull, upper limbs, and wrists.'

- abstract: 'Previous studies have demonstrated the connection between obesity and
    telomere length. A recently devised metric for determining obesity, the weight-adjusted-waist
    index (WWI), offers a distinct advantage in predicting fat and lean mass by depicting
    weight-independent abdominal adiposity. This article presents the results of the
    inaugural study on the relationship between WWI and telomere length in adult populations.
    The cross-sectional investigation analyzed data from 3479 participants from the
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from 1999
    to 2000. To inspect linear and nonlinear correlations, we adopted weighted multiple
    logistic regression analysis and smooth curve fit, respectively. In addition,
    threshold effects and subgroup analyses were accomplished. In the fully adapted
    model, a significant adverse association of WWI with telomere length was detected
    [β = -0.02, 95\% CI: (-0.03, -0.00), P value = 0.01]. The adverse correlation
    remained consistent across all subcategories. We also discovered an inverted U-shaped
    curve linking WWI and telomere length, with a conspicuous inflection point of
    10.07 cm/√kg. For the first time, our research demonstrated strong links between
    WWI and telomere length. The inflection point suggests that controlling WWI within
    an optimum range might be essential for aging and health.'

- abstract: Although an association between single polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
    (PAHs) adult exposure and telomere length has been reported, the evidence of mixed
    PAHs (1-napthol, 2-napthol, 3-fluorene, 2-fluorene, 3-phenanthrene, 1-phenanthrene,
    2-phenanthrene, and 1-pyrene) exposure and telomere length in the adult general
    population is still not clear. A total of 1460 adults over the age of 20 years
    provided urine information on 8 PAHs and selected covariates from the 2001-2002
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Bayesian nuclear machine
    regression (BKMR) was conducted to analyze these associations of telomere length
    in multiple PAH-exposed environments. Linear regression is mainly used for correlation
    analysis of PAHs with selected covariate adjustments. Restricted cubic spline
    (RCS) is used to estimate the correlation between selected PAHs and telomere length.
    After adjusting for potential covariates, PAHs mixed exposure was negatively associated
    with telomere length. The linear regression results showed that 2-napthol and
    2-fluorene were negatively correlated with telomere length. Telomere length decreased
    by 1.0\% in the fully adjusted model per increment of one unit in the base-10-logarithm-transformed
    2-napthol and 2-fluorene concentrations (P = 0.030 and 0.049, respectively). However,
    the other 6 PAH metabolites were not significantly different. In addition, RCS
    results showed that 2-napthol has a marginal dose effect relationship with telomere
    length. Our present study suggested that PAHs are negatively associated with telomere
    length in the general population of the USA. Considering that the low level of
    PAHs exposure in the general population can also induce reduced telomere length
    and potential health risks, future research is needed to explore potential mechanisms.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Due to the ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
    interest has arisen to realize the relationship between telomere length (TL) and
    influenza and pneumonia mortality. AIM: Our study attempted to investigate this
    correlation by analyzing information gathered from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. METHODS: A total of 7229 participants were
    involved in the conducted research. We utilized Cox proportional risk model analysis
    to determine the hazard ratio (HR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for TL and
    influenza and pneumonia mortality. RESULTS: During the average follow-up time
    of 204.10 ± 51.26 months, 33 (0.45\%) participants died from influenza and pneumonia.
    After adjusting for multiple variables, shorter TL was associated with higher
    influenza-pneumonia mortality. In subgroup analyses stratified by sex, men exhibited
    stronger associations with influenza-pneumonia mortality than women (Model 1:
    HR(male): 0.014 vs HR(female): 0.054; Model 2: HR(male): 0.082 vs HR(female):
    0.890; Model 3: HR(male): 0.072 vs HR(female): 0.776). For subgroup analyses by
    visceral adiposity index (VAI), all statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05)
    models displayed an inverse relationship between TL and influenza and pneumonia
    mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides further proof for the connection
    between shorter telomeres and higher influenza-pneumonia mortality. Larger prospective
    researches are essential to support our results and explain the underlying mechanisms.'

    disrupting chemicals that have myriad effects on human physiology. Estrogenic
    PFASs may influence biological aging by mimicking the activity of endogenous estrogens,
    which can decrease inflammation and oxidative stress and enhance telomerase activity.
    We hypothesized that PFAS exposure would be differentially associated with measures
    of biological aging based on biological sex and reproductive stage. METHODS: We
    analyzed associations between serum PFAS levels and measures of biological aging
    for pre- and postmenopausal women and men (n = 3193) using data from the 2003
    to 2018 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Examining
    PFASs both individually and in mixture models, we investigated four measures of
    clinical aging (Homeostatic Dysregulation, the Klemera-Doubal Method, Phenotypic
    Age Acceleration, and Allostatic Load), oxidative stress, and telomere length.
    RESULTS: PFOA and PFOS were negatively associated with Phenotypic Age Acceleration
    (e.g. decelerated aging) for men B = -0.22, 95\% CI: -0.32, -0.12; B = -0.04,
    95\% CI: -0.06, -0.03) , premenopausal women (B = -0.58, 95\% CI: -0.83, -0.32;
    B = -0.15, 95\% CI: -0.20, -0.09), and postmenopausal women (B= -0.22, 95\% CI:
    -0.43, -0.01; B = -0.05, 95\% CI: -0.08, -0.02). In mixture models, we found net
    negative effects for Phenotypic Age Acceleration and Allostatic Load for men,
    premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women. We also found significant mixture
    effects for the antioxidants bilirubin and albumin among the three sample groups.
    We found no evidence to support effects on telomere length. DISCUSSION: Our findings
    suggest that PFAS exposure may be inversely associated with some measures of biological
    aging at the relatively low levels of exposure in this sample, regardless of reproductive
    stage and sex, which does not support our hypothesis. This research provides insights
    into how PFAS exposure may variably influence aging measures depending on the
    physiological process investigated.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the correlation between lipoproteins and
    telomere length in US adults is limited. We aimed to investigate whether lipoproteins
    was associated with telomere length using US National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES) database. METHODS: A total of 6468 selected participants were
    identified in the NHANES Data Base (1999-2002). The independent and dependent
    variables were lipoproteins and telomere length, respectively. The covariates
    included demographic data, dietary data, physical examination data, and comorbidities.
    RESULTS: In fully-adjusted model, we found that 0.1 differences of telomere length
    were positively associated with HDL-C [0.19 (95\% CI 0.07, 0.31)], while the associations
    between LDL-C [0.19 (95\% CI -0.27, 0.65)], TG [- 1.00 (95\% CI -2.09, 0.07) and
    telomere length were not detected. By nonlinearity test, only the relationship
    between HDL-C and telomere length was nonlinear. The inflection point we got was
    1.25. On the left side of the inflection point (telomere length ≤ 1.25), a difference
    in 0.1 of telomere length was associated with 0.50 difference in HDL-C. CONCLUSION:
    After adjusting for demographic data, dietary data, physical examination data,
    and comorbidities, telomere length is not associated with LDL-C and TG, but is
    positively associated with HDL-C when telomere length is less than 1.25.'

- abstract: The exposome, reflecting the range of environmental exposures individuals
    encounter throughout their life, can influence a variety of health outcomes and
    can play a role in how the environment impacts our genes. Telomeres, genetic structures
    regulating cell growth and senescence, are one pathway through which the exposome
    may impact health. Greenspace exposure, representing the amount of green areas
    in one's neighborhood, is one component of the exposome and has been associated
    with multiple health benefits. To investigate the potential link between greenspace
    exposure and telomere length, we analyzed data from the 1999-2001 National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sample. Our study examined individual,
    risk, and contextual factors. We found that greater greenspace exposure in one's
    neighborhood was associated with longer telomere lengths when considering individual
    and risk factors, suggesting a positive effect of living in greener neighborhoods.
    However, this relationship became non-significant when contextual factors, such
    as air pollution and deprivation, were included in the analysis. These findings
    highlight a complex relationship between greenspace and telomere length, warranting
    further research to explore contextual factors in detail.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Telomere shortening is associated with age and
    risk of medical comorbidity. We assessed the relationship between measures of
    adiposity, leukocyte telomere length, and mortality and whether it is modified
    by age. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Subjects with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measures
    were identified using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002.
    Obesity was categorized using two body fat definitions (BF1\%: men ⩾25\%; females
    ⩾35\%; BF2\% ⩾28\% and ⩾38\%, respectively), body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference
    (WC; men ⩾102 cm; females ⩾88 cm). Telomere length relative to standard reference
    DNA (T/S ratio) was assessed using quantitative PCR. Weighted multivariable regression
    models evaluated the association of telomere length with adiposity, both continuously
    and categorically (low/normal BF\%, low/high WC and standard BMI categories).
    Differences in telomere length by age and adiposity were ascertained and subsequent
    models were stratified by age. Proportional hazard models assessed the risk of
    mortality by adiposity status. A telomere by adiposity interaction was tested
    in the entire cohort and by age category ({\textless}60 vs ⩾60 years; {\textless}70
    vs ⩾70 years). RESULTS: We identified 7827 subjects. Mean age was 46.1 years.
    Overall telomere length was 1.05±0.01 (s.e.) that differed by BF1\% (low/high:
    1.12±0.02 vs 1.03±0.02; P{\textless}0.001), BF2\% (1.02±0.02 vs 1.11±0.02; P{\textless}0.001),
    BMI (underweight 1.08±0.03; normal 1.09±0.02; overweight 1.04±0.02; and obese
    1.03±0.02;P{\textless}0.001) and WC (low/high 1.09±0.02 vs 1.02±0.02; P{\textless}0.001).
    Adjusted β-coefficients evaluating the relationship between telomere length and
    adiposity (measured continuously) were as follows: BF1\% (β=-0.0033±0.0008; P{\textless}0.001),
    BF2\% (-0.041±0.008; P{\textless}0.001), BMI (β=-0.025±0.0008; P=0.005) and WC
    (β=-0.0011±0.0004; P=0.007). High BF\% (BF1\%: β=-0.035±0.011; P=0.002; BF2\%:
    β=-0.041±0.008; P{\textless}0.001) and WC (β=-0.035±0.011; P=0.008) were inversely
    related to telomere length (TL). Stratifying by age, high BF1\% (-0.061±0.013),
    BF2\% (-0.065±0.01), BMI-obesity (-0.07±0.015) and high WC (-0.048±0.013) were
    significant (all P{\textless}0.001). This association diminished with increasing
    age. In older participants, TL was inversely related to mortality (hazard ratio
    0.36 (0.27, 0.49)), as were those classified by BF1\% (0.68 (0.56, 0.81)), BF2\%
    (0.75 (0.65, 0.80)), BMI (0.50 (0.42, 0.60)) and WC (0.72 (0.63, 0.83)). No interaction
    was observed between adiposity status, telomere length and mortality. CONCLUSIONS:
    Obesity is associated with shorter telomere length in young participants, a relationship
    that diminishes with increasing age. It does not moderate the relationship with
    mortality.'

- abstract: The length of telomeres is an objective measure of biologic ageing. This
    study evaluated the extent minutes of walking per week are associated with leukocyte
    telomere length (LTL) in a random sample of 5,823 U.S. adults. The investigation
    was cross-sectional and data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES). LTL was measured by the quantitative polymerase chain
    reaction method. Walking minutes was calculated from walking frequency and duration
    measures. Results showed that for each year of chronological age, telomeres were
    15.6 base pairs shorter (P {\textless} 0.0001). With walking minutes and LTL treated
    as continuous variables, the relationship was quadratic, not linear (F = 11.2,
    P = 0.0023). With walking time divided into three categories, adults who performed
    ≥ 150 minutes of walking per week had longer telomeres than those who did no regular
    walking, and those who did some, but less than the recommendation (F = 5.0, P
    = 0.0137). Regular walkers were estimated to have a biologic ageing advantage
    associated with 6.5-7.6 years less biologic ageing compared to non-walkers, after
    adjusting for covariates. Additional investigations designed to study causality
    and the mechanisms associated with the walking and LTL relationship are needed.

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: The rate of biological aging is influenced by various factors
    such as genetics, environment, and diet. The dietary inflammatory index (DII)
    is strongly associated with various chronic diseases. The aim of this study was
    to investigate the association between DII and biological aging in US adults using
    quantitative indicators. METHODS: Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018, weighted multiple linear regression models,
    generalized weighted models, and smoothed fitted curves were used to investigate
    the linear and nonlinear relationships of DII with four biological markers of
    aging (biological age, phenotypic age, telomere length, and serum klotho concentration).
    RESULTS: A total of 35,575 adult participants with complete data were included
    in the study. After adjusting for all confounders, significant positive correlations
    were found between DII with biological age [0.070 (0.045, 0.095)] and phenotypic
    age [0.421 (0.371, 0.471)], with an increase of 0.07 and 0.42 years in biological
    age and phenotypic age, respectively, for each increase in DII score. The negative
    correlations between DII with telomere length [ - 0.005 ( - 0.008, - 0.002)] and
    klotho [ - 3.874 ( - 7.409, - 0.338)] were significant only in partially adjusted
    models and differed across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, higher
    DII scores (greater pro-inflammatory dietary potential) were associated with biological
    aging. These findings may contribute to the development of aging prevention strategies
    through dietary interventions.'

    associated with mortality. This study aimed to investigate the potential association
    between LTL and all-cause mortality as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality
    in middle-aged or older individuals without a history of CVD. METHODS: A total
    of 4174 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2002 were included in this analysis. Cox proportional
    hazards regression models were utilized to estimate the association between LTL
    and mortality outcomes. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were employed to
    evaluate the potential non-linear association. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up
    period of 217 months, the weighted rates of all-cause mortality and CVD mortality
    were 28.58\% and 8.32\% respectively. Participants in the highest LTL group exhibited
    a significantly decreased risk of both all-cause mortality (HR: 0.65, 95\% CI:
    0.54-0.78, P {\textless} 0.001) and CVD mortality (HR: 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.45-0.93,
    P {\textless} 0.001) compared to those in the lowest group. Kaplan-Meier survival
    curves further supported a significant association between shorter telomere length
    and increased risks of both all-cause and CVD mortality (log-rank test P {\textless}
    0.001). RCS curves demonstrated a linear dose-response relationship between LTL
    and all-cause mortality as well as CVD mortality. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
    confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: Shorter leukocyte telomere
    length could serve as a potential biomarker for risk stratification of all-cause
    and CVD mortality among middle-aged and older individuals without a history of
    CVD.'

    telomere length (LTL) and erectile dysfunction (ED) among a nationally representative
    sample of US adults. DESIGN: Secondary population-based study. SETTING: The National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2001-2002). PARTICIPANTS: A
    total of 1694 male participants were extracted from the NHANES database for 2001-2002.
    PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary focus of the study was to
    determine the association between the LTL and ED, using multivariate logistic
    regression and restricted cubic spline models for examination. The secondary outcome
    measures involved conducting stratified subgroup analyses to exclude interactions
    of different variables with the LTL. RESULTS: Participants with ED had shorter
    LTLs than those without ED (p{\textless}0.05). After adjusting for confounding
    factors, compared with the reference lowest LTL quartile, the ORs and 95\% CIs
    for the second, third and fourth LTL quartiles were (OR 1.51; 95\% CI 1.01 to

    In addition, restricted cubic splines showed an inverted J-curve relationship
    between the LTL and ED. At an LTL of 1.037, the curve showed an inflection point.
    The ORs (95\% CI) of ED on the left and right sides of the inflection point were

- abstract: 'As an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, vitamin K has the potential
    to reduce telomere attrition. However, the correlation between dietary vitamin
    K and telomere length (TL) has not been reported. We aimed to investigate the
    association between these 2 variables. This study included 3754 participants from
    the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2002 database. We used
    multivariate linear regression and restricted cubic splines to assess the relationship
    between dietary vitamin K intake and TL. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests
    were utilized to examine the stability of the results. After adjusting for all
    variables, each unit increase in daily dietary intake of vitamin K lengthened
    telomeres by 0.22 base pairs (β = 0.22, 95\% CI: 0.09-0.36, P = .001). Individuals
    with the highest dietary vitamin K intake had significantly longer TL (β = 80.27,
    95\% CI: 20.83-139.71, P = .008). Subgroup analyses suggested that this association
    persisted in populations stratified by gender, age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease
    (CVD), body mass index and total energy intake (P for interaction {\textgreater}
    .05). A linear relationship between dietary vitamin K intake and TL was observed
    in restricted cubic splines (P for nonlinear = .554). In conclusion, our findings
    suggest that dietary vitamin K intake is positively associated with TL, providing
    recent evidence to guide the management of healthy diets.'

    with sarcopenia (referent = no sarcopenia). RESULTS: We identified 2672 subjects.
    Mean age was 70.9 years (55.5\% female). Prevalence of ALM and ALM:BMI sarcopenia
    was 29.2 and 22.1\%. Deaths were higher in persons with sarcopenia as compared
    to those without sarcopenia (ALM: 46.4 vs. 33.4\%, p {\textless} 0.001; ALM:BMI:
    46.7 vs. 33.2\%, p {\textless} 0.001). No adjusted differences were observed in
    telomere length in those with/without sarcopenia (ALM: 0.90 vs. 0.92, p = 0.74,
    ALM:BMI 0.89 vs. 0.92, p = 0.24). In men with ALM:BMI-defined sarcopenia, adjusted
    telomere length was significantly lower compared to men without sarcopenia (0.85
    vs. 0.91, p = 0.013). With sarcopenia, we did not observe a significant association
    between telomere length and mortality (ALM: HR 1.11 [0.64,1.82], p = 0.68; ALM:BMI:
    HR 0.97 [0.53,1.77], p = 0.91), but noted significance in those without sarcopenia
    with mortality (ALM: HR 0.59 [0.40,0.86], p = 0.007; ALM:BMI: HR 0.62 [0.42,0.91];
    p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a potentially inverse relationship between
    telomere length and mortality in those without sarcopenia but did not observe
    a significant relationship between telomere length and mortality in the presence
    of sarcopenia.'

- abstract: 'Background: Multilevel frameworks suggest neighborhood circumstances
    influence biology; however, this relationship is not well studied. Telomere length
    (TL) shortening has been associated with individual-level and neighborhood-level
    exposures and disease and may provide insights into underlying biologic mechanisms
    linking neighborhood with biology. To support neighborhood-biology investigations,
    we sought to determine the independent effect of neighborhood exposures on TL
    using standard multilevel linear regression models and quantile regression, a
    nonlinear, social science method applicable for testing the biologic hypothesis
    that extremes of the TL distribution are related to poor outcomes.Methods: In
    a multicenter, cross-sectional study, blood TL was measured in 1,488 individuals
    from 127 census tracts in three U.S. regions using terminal restriction fragment
    assays. Multilevel linear and quantile regression models were adjusted for individual-level
    race, education, perceived stress, and depression. Neighborhood exposures included
    population density, urban/residential crowding, residential stability/mobility,
    and socioeconomic status.Results: TL was not associated with any neighborhood
    variable using linear models, but quantile regression revealed inverse associations
    between population density and urban crowding at the lower tails of the TL distribution
    [5th (population density P = 0.03; urban crowding P = 0.002), 50th (both P {\textless}
    0.001), 75th percentiles (both P {\textless} 0.001)]. TL was related to residential
    stability at the upper tail (95th percentile P = 0.006).Conclusions: Findings
    support the use of nonlinear statistical methods in TL research and suggest that
    neighborhood exposures can result in biological effects.Impact: TL may serve as
    an underlying example of a biologic mechanism that can link neighborhood with
    biology, thus supporting multilevel investigations in future studies. Cancer Epidemiol

    on metabolic heath, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis among 645 adults aged
    20 and older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
    examining the association between nine phthalate metabolites (Mono-n-butyl phthalate
    (MBP), Mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), Mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP), Mono-benzyl
    phthalate (MBzP), Mono-n-methyl phthalate (MnMP), Mono-(3-carboxy propyl) phthalate
    (MCPP), Mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), Mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)
    phthalate (MEOHP), Mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP)) and six glucose homeostasis
    indices (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, hemoglobin A(1C) (HbA(1C)), homeostatic
    model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), single Point Insulin Sensitivity
    Estimator (SPISE), and HOMA-β). Latent Class Analysis identified three phthalate
    metabolites exposure patterns: high MEP-low MEOHP (n = 282), high MBzP-low MEHHP
    (n = 214), and high MEHHP, MEOHP (n = 149). The high MBzP-low MEHHP and high MEHHP,
    MEOHP, versus the high MEP-low MEOHP, exposure groups showed significantly higher
    levels of fasting insulin (β = 0.126, 95\% CI: 0.023-0.228), SPISE (β = 0.091,
    95\% CI: 0.018-0.164), and HOMA-IR (β = 0.091, 95\% CI: 0.018-0.164). In the shorter
    telomere length group, high MEHHP, MEOHP exposure showed an increase in SPISE
    levels (β = 0.153, 95\% CI: 0.037-0.269), while in the overweight/obese subgroup,
    high MEHHP, MEOHP exposure was significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR
    (β = 0.392, 95\% CI: 0.150-0.735). Bayesian kernel machine regression analyses
    showed positive associations between higher combined phthalate exposure and increased
    glucose homeostasis indices (fasting glucose, HbA(1C), fasting insulin, SPISE,
    and HOMA-IR). The quantile of g-calculation analysis also supported the positive
    associations with HbA(1C), HOMA-IR, and fasting insulin. Our findings indicate
    that phthalate exposure was positively associated with glucose homeostasis indices,
    which strengthen the call for proactive measures to reduce phthalate exposure
    and mitigate potential risks to glucose metabolism.'

- abstract: 'Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences (TTAGGG) at the end of chromosomes.
    Cells with critically short telomeres enter replicative senescence and apoptosis.
    Several in vitro studies report that antimony causes cell apoptosis in human leukocyte
    cell lines. The goal of this analysis was to investigate whether there is an association
    between antimony exposure and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) among US adults
    aged 20 and older based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    (NHANES) 1999-2002. We used multivariate linear regression to analyze the association
    of urinary antimony with LTL. LTL was log-natural transformed and the results
    were re-transformed and presented as percent differences. After adjustment for
    potential confounders, individuals in the 3rd and 4th quartiles of urinary antimony
    had statistically significantly shorter LTL (-4.78\%, 95\% CI: -8.42,-0.90; and
    -6.11\%, 95\% CI: -11.04,-1.00, respectively) compared to the lowest referent
    quartile, with evidence of a dose-response relationship (p-value for trend =0.03).
    Shorter LTL with antimony was driven by middle aged (40-59 years) and older (60-85
    years) adult groups. The association may be biologically plausible because of
    reported oxidative stress and apoptosis effects of antimony on blood cells, effects
    known to shorten telomere length.'

- abstract: 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association
    between biological aging and liver fibrosis in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated
    steatotic liver disease (MASLD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed NHANES 2017-2020
    data to calculate phenotypic age. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were identified
    using controlled attenuation parameters (CAP), fatty liver index (FLI) and transient
    elastography (TE). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95 \% confidence intervals (CI) for
    significant MASLD fibrosis were calculated using multivariate logistic regression,
    and subgroup analyses were performed. We explored the potential causal relationship
    between telomere length and liver fibrosis using Mendelian randomization (MR).
    Additionally, we used the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) method and
    GSE197112 data to identify genes related to liver fibrosis and senescence. Finally,
    the APOLD1 expression was validated using GSE89632. RESULTS: Phenotypic age was
    associated with liver fibrosis occurrence in MASLD (OR = 1.08, 95 \% CI 1.05-1.12).
    Subgroup analyses by BMI and age revealed differences. For obese or young to middle-aged
    MASLD patients, phenotypic age is significantly associated with liver fibrosis.
    (OR = 1.14, 95 \% CI 1.10-1.18; OR = 1.07, 95 \% CI 1.01-1.14 and OR = 1.14, 95
    \% CI 1.07-1.22). MR revealed a negative association between telomere length and
    liver fibrosis (IVW method: OR = 0.63288, 95 \% CI 0.42498-0.94249). The gene
    APOLD1 was identified as a potential target through the intersection of the GEO
    dataset and eQTL genes. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasized the link between biological
    aging and fibrosis in young to middle-aged obese MASLD patients. We introduced
    phenotypic age as a clinical indicator and identified APOLD1 as a potential therapeutic
    target.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Currently, telomere length is known to reflect the replication
    potential and longevity of cells, and many studies have reported that telomere
    length is associated with age-related diseases and biological aging. Studies have
    also shown that vitamin C acts as an oxidant and free radical scavenger to protect
    cells from oxidative stress and telomere wear, thus achieving anti-aging effects.
    At present, there are few and incomplete studies on the relationship between vitamin
    C and telomere length, so this study aims to explore the relationship between
    vitamin C and telomere length. METHODS: This study used cross-sectional data from
    the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) database from 1999
    to 2002, a total of 7,094 participants were selected from all races in the United
    States. Male participants accounted for 48.2\% and female participants accounted
    for 51.8\%. The correlation between vitamin C and telomere length was assessed
    using a multiple linear regression model, and the effect of dietary vitamin C
    on telomere length was obtained after adjusting for confounding factors such as
    age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and poverty income ratio (PIR). RESULTS:
    This cross-sectional study showed that vitamin C was positively correlated with
    telomere length, with greater dietary vitamin C intake associated with longer
    telomeres (β = 0.03, 95\% CI: 0.01-0.05, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: This study shows
    that vitamin C intake is positively correlated with human telomere length, which
    is of guiding significance for our clinical guidance on people''s health care,
    but our study need to be confirmed by more in-depth and comprehensive other research
    results.'

- abstract: Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease defined by the presence
    of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. While its etiology is largely
    unknown, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation plays a major role.
    Our objective was to investigate the association between peripheral blood leukocyte
    telomere length (LTL) and endometriosis using data from two large population-based
    studies, the New England Case-Control Study (NEC; n = 877) and the National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 2268). NEC control participants
    were identified through a combination of random digit dialing, drivers' license
    lists, and town resident lists. In NHANES, selection algorithms were used to identify
    a nationally representative sample. Blood samples and demographic, reproductive,
    and health-related information were available from both data sources. Endometriosis
    was defined as self-reported of physician-diagnosed endometriosis. LTL was measured
    using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Multivariable logistic regression
    was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for
    the association between LTL and endometriosis. Shorter LTL was associated with
    greater odds of history of endometriosis. In NEC, women with the shortest LTL
    tertile compared with the longest had a 2.5-fold greater odds of endometriosis
    (OR(T3/T1) = 2.56, 95\% CI = 1.16-5.63; p value, test for linear trend = 0.02).
    The association was stronger among women who usually experienced moderate or severe
    menstrual pain (OR (T3/T1) = 3.50, 95\% CI = 1.12-10.97). In NHANES, the data
    suggested a similar but attenuated association (OR(T3/T1) = 1.29, 95\% CI = 0.85-1.96).
    The observed associations in NEC suggest that shorter LTL may be associated with
    greater odds of endometriosis. A better understanding of how LTL influences endometriosis
    risk could elucidate novel disease pathophysiology.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to cadmium-polluted environments may lead
    to shortened leukocyte telomere length and cognitive decline. This study aims
    to investigate (1) the associations among blood cadmium levels, leukocyte telomere
    length, and cognitive function, and (2) the mediating role of leukocyte telomere
    length between blood cadmium levels and cognitive function among older adults
    in the United States. METHODS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. Cadmium exposure level was assessed by
    measuring cadmium levels in blood samples. Leukocyte telomere length was measured
    by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and cognitive function was measured
    by the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). RESULTS: A total of 2185 older adults
    aged over 60 were included in this study, comprising 1109 (49.65\%) males. Elevated
    blood cadmium levels were significantly associated with the risk of a decline
    in cognitive function (β = - 2.842, p = 0.018). Shorter leukocyte telomere lengths
    were significantly associated with a higher risk of a decline in cognitive function
    (β = 4.144, p = 0.020). The total indirect effect on the blood cadmium level and
    cognitive function via leukocyte telomere length was - 0.218 (p = 0.012). The
    mediation effect was estimated to be 0.218/2.084 × 100\% = 10.46\%. CONCLUSION:
    The findings suggest that cadmium exposure may increase the risk of cognitive
    impairment by causing shortened leukocyte telomere length.'

- abstract: 'The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified the di-2-ethylhexyl
    phthalate (DEHP) as "possibly carcinogenic to humans". In vitro studies reported
    that phthalate exposure resulted in induction of several nuclear transcription
    factors that are activators of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase
    activity of the human telomerase complex. The objective of this study was to determine
    whether there is an association between urinary phthalate metabolites [mono-ethyl
    phthalate (MEP), mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP),
    and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in the adult
    population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002
    (n=2472). After adjustment for potential confounders, participants in the 3rd
    and 4th quartiles of urinary MEHP had statistically significantly longer LTL (5.34\%,
    95\% CI: 1.31, 9.53; and 7.14\%, 95\% CI: 2.94, 11.63; respectively) compared
    to the lowest quartile, with evidence of a dose-response relationship (p-trend=0.01).
    The association remained when the analyses were stratified by age groups (20-39years,
    40-59years, and 60years and older), and sex. Furthermore, MBP and MBzP were associated
    with higher LTL in older participants. The age independent association between
    longer LTL and MEHP (a metabolite of DEHP) might suggest a possible role of MEHP
    as tumor promoter.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) serves as a significant biomarker
    of aging. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a commonly observed condition among middle-aged
    and older men. The objective of this study is to explore the potential association
    between LTL and ED. METHODS: We utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine the association between LTL and ED. Weighted
    multivariate regression analyses were performed as the primary statistical method.
    Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate specific population subsets, and
    restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to assess the non-linear
    relationship between LTL and ED. RESULTS: The results of weighted multivariate
    regression analyses revealed a negative correlation between LTL and the risk of
    ED. Individuals with ED exhibited shorter LTL compared to those without ED. For
    each unit increase in LTL, there was a 54\% reduction in the risk of ED (odds
    ratios[OR] 0.46, 95\% confidence intervals[CI] 0.25-0.85). When LTL was considered
    as a categorical variable, the group with the longest LTL (Q5) had a 44\% lower
    risk of ED compared to the group with the shortest LTL(Q1) (OR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.39-0.81).
    A non-linear relationship was observed between TL and ED. Various sensitivity
    analyses were conducted to validate the stability of the results, and consistent
    findings were obtained. CONCLUSION: The negative association between leukocyte
    LTL and ED suggests that delaying the shortening of LTL may decrease the risk
    of ED.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Leukocytes telomere length (LTL) was reported to be associated
    with cellular aging and aging related disease. Urine metal also might accelerate
    the development of aging related disease. We aimed to analyze the association
    between LTL and urinary metals. METHODS: In this research, we screened all cycles
    of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, and download
    the eligible dataset in NHANES 1999-2002 containing demographic, disease history,
    eight urine metal, and LTL. The analysis in this research had three steps including
    baseline difference comparison, multiple linear regression (MLR) for hazardous
    urine metals, and artificial neural network (ANN, based on Tensorflow framework)
    to make LTL prediction. RESULTS: The MLR results showed that urinary cadmium (Cd)
    was negatively correlated with LTL in the USA population [third quantile: -9.36,
    95\% confidential interval (CI) = (-19.7, -2.32)], and in the elderly urinary
    molybdenum (Mo) was positively associated with LTL [third quantile: 24.37, 95\%CI
    = (5.42, 63.55)]. An ANN model was constructed, which had 24 neurons, 0.375 exit
    rate in the first layer, 15 neurons with 0.53 exit rate in the second layer, and
    7 neurons with 0.86 exit rate in the third layer. The squared error loss (LOSS)
    and mean absolute error (MAE) in the ANN model were 0.054 and 0.181, respectively,
    which showed a low error rate. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in adults especially
    the elderly, the relationships between urinary Cd and Mo might be worthy of further
    research. An accurate prediction model based on ANN could be further analyzed.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: This study examines the association of periodontitis with
    telomere length (TL) and effect modification by population characteristics. METHODS:
    We analyzed data from 3,478 participants from the 1999 to 2002 National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey. Probing depth, attachment loss, and bleed on
    probing (BOP, available for 1,973 participants only) were examined on the distal,
    mesial, or mid-facial site of each tooth in two randomly selected quadrants. We
    defined periodontitis severity according to the Centers for Disease Control/American
    Academy of Periodontology guideline. TL from leukocytes was measured with qPCR.
    We used linear and logistic regression to examine the adjusted association of
    different severity of periodontitis and BOP with continuous TL (bp) and dichotomized
    short TL ({\textless}median), respectively. To assess effect modification, we
    stratified the analyses by a priori selected population characteristics including
    sex, age, body weight status, smoking, and cardiometabolic comorbidity. RESULTS:
    Moderate BOP ({\textless}10\% bleeding sites) was significantly associated with
    a shorter continuous TL (β = -89.0, SE = 37.8). Moderate to severe periodontitis
    was significantly associated with 47\% (95\% confidence interval [IL], 1.04 to
    2.09) higher odds of shorter TL, compared with those with mild or no periodontitis.
    The association was stronger in those who were female (adjusted OR, 1.76; 95\%
    CI, 1.10 to 2.83), overweight or obese (adjusted OR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 2.41),
    or had cardiometabolic comorbidities (adjusted OR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.38 to 3.29).
    CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis was associated with TL, a biomarker of cellular aging.
    The association was stronger in females, overweight or obese, or those with cardiometabolic
    diseases. Treatment on periodontitis could potentially protect individuals from
    aging-related diseases.'

- abstract: 'Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) induce the expression of the proto-oncogene
    c-myc which has a role in cellular growth and proliferation programs. The c-myc
    up-regulates the telomerase reverse transcriptase which adds the telomeres repeating
    sequences to the chromosomal ends to compensate for the progressive loss of telomeric
    sequence. We performed multivariate linear regression to analyze the association
    of PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran
    with leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in the adult population (n = 2413) of the
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. LTL was natural log-transformed
    and the results were re-transformed and presented as percent differences. Individuals
    in the 3rd and 4th quartiles of the sum of PCBs were associated with 8.33\% (95\%
    CI: 4.08-13.88) and 11.63\% (95\% CI: 6.18-17.35) longer LTLs, respectively, compared
    with the lowest quartile, with evidence of a dose-response relationship (p-trend

    both sexes. Additionally, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
    were associated with longer LTL. The age independent association between longer

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Previous studies have shown that plant-rich dietary
    patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, are associated with longer telomeres.
    However, no association has been found between vegetarian diet and telomere length.
    We hypothesized that the quality of plant-based diets plays an important role
    in telomere length. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey 1999-2002. Diet was assessed using a 24-h recall method. Plant-based
    diet quality was assessed using the overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthy
    PDI (hPDI), and unhealthy PDI (uPDI). Telomere length was measured using quantitative
    PCR. Linear and ordinal logistic regression models were used to assess the association
    of PDIs with log-transformed telomere length and ordinal quintiles of telomere
    length in descending order, respectively. RESULTS: In both regression models,
    the overall PDI was not associated with telomere length. The hPDI was associated
    with longer telomere length [percentage change = 2.34\%, 95\% confidence interval
    (CI): 0.42\%, 4.31\%, P(trend) = 0.016; odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.69,
    0.95, P(trend) = 0.013]. However, uPDI was associated with shorter telomere length
    (percentage change = -3.17\%, 95\% CI: -5.65\%, -0.62\%, P(trend) = 0.017; OR
    = 1.25, 95\% CI:1.03, 1.53, P(trend) = 0.014) and this inverse association was
    stronger in the non-Hispanic white population (P(interaction) = 0.001 in both
    regression models). CONCLUSIONS: A plant-based dietary pattern rich in healthy
    plant foods is associated with longer telomeres. However, plant-based dietary
    patterns rich in unhealthy plant-based foods are associated with shorter telomere
    lengths, especially in non-Hispanic white populations.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity
    is prevalent but its relation with leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a cellular
    aging biomarker, is unclear. METHODS: Among 3,472 participants from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycle 1999-2000, LTL was measured
    with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction. H pylori IgG was measured by
    enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and defined as seropositivity with an immune
    status ratio score {\textgreater} 0.9. We used linear regression models to examine
    the relation of H pylori IgG seropositivity with continuous LTL and logistic regression
    for the relation with short LTL ({\textless}10th percentile of the population
    distribution) adjusting for potential confounders. We stratified the analyses
    by a priori selected variables. RESULTS: Population prevalence of H pylori IgG
    seropositivity was 31.5\% in the overall population with higher prevalence found
    in those with older age, other races than non-Hispanic whites, lower education,
    and being born out of the United States. Continuous LTL was non-significantly
    shorter in those with H Pylori IgG seropositivity versus seronegativity (mean
    difference = -40.3 bp, 95\% CI: -112.4, 31.9). This difference was not significant
    after adjusting for potential confounders nor stratifying by potential effect
    modifiers. H Pylori IgG seropositivity was significantly associated with short
    LTL among the elderly (55-75 years, adjusted OR: 3.06, 95\% CI: 1.17, 7.99), but
    not in the overall population (OR: 1.28, 95\% CI: 0.81-2.02). CONCLUSION: H Pylori
    IgG seropositivity was not associated with continuous LTL in the general population
    but may be associated with an excessively short LTL in the elderly.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Telomere length is closely associated with the occurrence
    and development of cardiovascular and other diseases. Monocyte to high-density
    lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) is a novel indicator of inflammation, oxidative
    stress, and metabolic syndrome, with some predictive ability for related disease
    risks in clinical practice. However, there is no research on the correlation between
    these two factors. METHODS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2002, we conducted analysis and research
    on the correlation between MHR and telomere length using the Kruskal-Wallis H
    test, Spearman rank correlation analysis, and partial correlation analysis. Weighted
    linear regression analysis assessed the strength of the association between the
    two variables, while restricted cubic spline regression (RCS) explored potential
    nonlinear relationships between them. RESULTS: The results of correlation analysis
    showed that MHR levels were negatively correlated with telomere length (ρ=-0.083,
    P {\textless} 0.001), and this relationship remained statistically significant
    after controlling for other covariates (P all {\textless} 0.001). Weighted linear
    regression analysis showed that after adjusting for all covariates, MHR remained
    negatively associated with telomere length (β = -0.020; 95\% CI: -0.039 to -0.002;
    P = 0.037). Subgroup analysis shows that the negative association between MHR
    and telomere length appeared more striking among females (𝛽 = -0.024; 95\%CI:
    -0.050 to 0.001; P = 0.058), the Non-Hispanic White (𝛽 = -0.022; 95\%CI: -0.045
    to 0.002; P = 0.066), and other race (𝛽 = -0.067; 95\%CI: -0.134 to -0.000; P
    = 0.049). Using RCS explored potential nonlinear relationships between MHR and
    telomere length, revealing no nonlinear relationship between the two (P = 0.102).
    CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a negative correlation between MHR levels and
    telomere length in American adults. More comprehensive research is needed to confirm
    these findings in the future.'

- abstract: Leukocyte telomere length is shorter in response to chronic disease processes
    associated with inflammation such as diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.
    Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999
    to 2002 was used to explore the relationship between leukocyte telomere length
    and presumed NAFLD, as indicated by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
    levels, obesity, or abdominal obesity. Logistic regression models were used to
    evaluate the relationship between telomere length and presumed markers of NAFLD
    adjusting for possible confounders. There was no relationship between elevated
    ALT levels, abdominal obesity, or obesity and telomere length in adjusted models
    in NHANES (OR 1.13, 95\% CI 0.48-2.65; OR 1.17, 95\% CI 0.52-2.62, resp.). Mexican-American
    men had shorter telomere length in relation to presumed NAFLD (OR 0.07, 95\% CI
    0.006-0.79) and using different indicators of NAFLD (OR 0.012, 95\% CI 0.0006-0.24).
    Mexican origin with presumed NAFLD had shorter telomere length than men in other
    population groups. Longitudinal studies are necessary to evaluate the role of
    telomere length as a potential predictor to assess pathogenesis of NALFD in Mexicans.

- abstract: The principal objective was to determine the extent to which physical
    activity (PA) accounts for differences in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in a
    large random sample of U.S. adults. Another purpose was to assess the extent to
    which multiple demographic and lifestyle covariates affect the relationship between
    PA and LTL. A total of 5823 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES 1999-2002) were studied cross-sectionally. Employing the quantitative
    polymerase chain reaction method, LTL was compared to standard reference DNA.
    PA was indexed using MET-minutes using self-reported frequency, intensity, and
    duration of participation in 62 physical activities. Covariates were controlled
    statistically. Telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter for each year of chronological
    age (F=723.2, P{\textless}0.0001). PA was inversely related to LTL after adjusting
    for all the covariates (F=8.3, P=0.0004). Telomere base pair differences between
    adults with High activity and those in the Sedentary, Low, and Moderate groups
    were 140, 137, and 111, respectively. Adults with High activity were estimated
    to have a biologic aging advantage of 9years (140 base pairs÷15.6) over Sedentary
    adults. The difference in cell aging between those with High and Low activity
    was also significant, 8.8years, as was the difference between those with High
    and Moderate PA (7.1years). Overall, PA was significantly and meaningfully associated
    with telomere length in U.S. men and women. Evidently, adults who participate
    in high levels of PA tend to have longer telomeres, accounting for years of reduced
    cellular aging compared to their more sedentary counterparts.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Telomere length, which is related to chronic diseases and
    premature mortality, is influenced by dietary factors. Zinc is known as a dietary
    antioxidant micronutrient, however, its impact on telomere length remains unclear.
    OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential effect of dietary zinc intake on
    telomere length among middle-aged and older individuals in the US. MATERIALS AND
    METHODS: Our study included 3,793 US participants aged 45 years and older from
    the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 24-h
    dietary recall interviews were employed to evaluate zinc consumption. Leukocyte
    telomere length was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
    (qPCR). We adopted generalized linear models to investigate the effect of dietary
    zinc intake on telomere length, and subgroup analyses were further applied. We
    further evaluated the dose-response relationship using restricted cubic spline
    analysis. RESULTS: Among the 3,793 participants, the average telomere length was
    0.926 ± 0.205 (T/S ratio) or 5509.5 ± 494.9 (bp). After adjusting for major confounders,
    every 5 mg increment in dietary zinc consumption was related to 0.64\% (95\% CI:
    0.17\%, 1.10\%) longer telomere length. In the subgroup analyses, significant
    relationships were found in females (Percentage change: 1.11\%; 95\% CI: 0.48\%,
    1.75\%), obese (Percentage change: 0.88\%; 95\% CI: 0.26\%, 1.50\%), and low energy
    intake individuals (Percentage change: 0.99\%; 95\% CI: 0.51\%, 1.46\%). Additionally,
    we revealed a positive linear relationship between dietary zinc intake and telomere
    length (P for non-linearity = 0.636). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that elevated
    dietary zinc intake was significantly related to longer telomere length among
    adults aged 45 years and older in the US. And the association was more pronounced
    in females, obese, and low energy intake individuals.'

- abstract: 'AIMS: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL), as a biomarker of biological aging,
    is associated with the prevalence and complications of diabetes. This study aims
    to investigate the associations between LTL and all-cause and cause-specific mortality
    in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: All participants with baseline LTL
    records were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    1999-2002. Death status and its causes were ascertained for National Death Index
    based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code. Cox proportional
    hazards regression models were established to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs)
    of LTL associating with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: The study
    enrolled 804 diabetic patients with the mean follow-up of 14.9 ± 2.59 years. There
    were 367 (45.6\%) all-cause deaths, 80 (10.0\%) cardiovascular deaths, and 42
    (5.2\%) cancer-related deaths. Longer LTL was associated with reduced all-cause
    mortality, whereas this association disappeared after adjusting for other variables.
    Compared with the lowest tertiles of LTL, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio
    of cardiovascular mortality was 2.11 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-3.39;
    p {\textless} .05) in the highest tertiles. In terms of cancer mortality, the
    highest tertile was negatively correlated with the risk of cancer mortality (HR
    0.58 [95\% CI 0.37, 0.91], p {\textless} .05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, LTL
    was independently associated with the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients
    with type 2 diabetes and was negatively correlated with the risk of cancer mortality.
    Telomere length may be a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in diabetes.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: More indications proved that diet might be involved in the
    telomere length, a marker of biological aging and chronic diseases. Copper is
    widely viewed as one of the essential elements in the diet. Therefore, this study
    aimed to evaluate the relationship between telomere length and dietary copper
    intake in hypertension and provide a basis for guiding dietary copper intake in
    patients with hypertension. METHODS: The data was collected from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. The
    relevance between telomere length and dietary copper intake in hypertension is
    assessed using a multivariable linear regression model. RESULTS: We gathered 1,867
    participants with hypertension with assessed telomere length and dietary copper
    intake. We found that one unit increasing log-transformed dietary copper intake
    in hypertension was significantly associated with longer telomere length base
    pair (bp) (β = 112.20, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 5.48, 218.92), after controlling
    for covariates, including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), physical
    activity, and taking medication for hypertension. For the age group, we found
    that one unit increasing log-transformed dietary copper in hypertension was associated
    with longer telomere length (β = 237.95, 95\% CI: 114.39, 361.51) in the age group
    {\textgreater}45 years. The grouping was based on whether the participants take
    medication for hypertension. We found that one unit increasing log-transformed
    dietary copper in hypertension was associated with longer telomere length (β =
    116.47, 95\% CI: 0.72, 232.21) in the group that takes medication for hypertension.
    CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that dietary copper intake was associated
    with longer telomere length in patients with hypertension, which provides evidence
    for guiding dietary copper intake in patients with hypertension. However, further
    studies are needed to evaluate the effect of copper supplementation on telomere
    length in patients with hypertension in well-designed random control studies and
    prospective studies.'

- abstract: 'A growing body of literature on military personnel and veterans'' health
    suggests that prior military service may be associated with exposures that increase
    the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which may differ by race/ethnicity.
    This study examined the hypothesis that differential telomere shortening, a measure
    of cellular aging, by race/ethnicity may explain prior findings of differential
    CVD risk in racial/ethnic groups with military service. Data from the first two
    continuous waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
    administered from 1999-2002 were analyzed. Mean telomere length in base pairs
    was analyzed with multivariable adjusted linear regression with complex sample
    design, stratified by sex. The unadjusted mean telomere length was 225.8 base
    shorter for individuals with prior military service. The mean telomere length
    for men was 47.2 (95\% CI: -92.9, -1.5; p {\textless} 0.05) base pairs shorter
    for men with military service after adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic,
    and behavioral variables, but did not differ significantly in women with and without
    prior military service. The interaction between military service and race/ethnicity
    was not significant for men or women. The results suggest that military service
    may contribute to accelerated aging as a result of health damaging exposures,
    such as combat, injury, and environmental contaminants, though other unmeasured
    confounders could also potentially explain the results.'

- abstract: Antioxidants have a number of potential health benefits. The present investigation
    was designed to determine the relationship between serum alpha- and gamma-tocopherol
    levels (powerful antioxidants), and leukocyte telomere length (a biomarker of
    biological aging). A cross-sectional design was employed to study 5768 adults
    from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). DNA was obtained
    via blood samples. Telomere length was assessed using the quantitative polymerase
    chain reaction method. Serum concentrations of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol were
    measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that
    for each one-year increase in age, telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter (F =
    410.4, p {\textless} 0.0001). After adjusting for differences in the demographic
    covariates, for each µg/dL higher level of gamma-tocopherol, telomeres were 0.33
    base pairs shorter (F = 7.1, p = 0.0126). Telomeres were approximately 1 year
    shorter (15.6 base pairs) for each increment of 47.3 to 55.7 µg/dL of gamma-tocopherol
    in the blood, depending on the variables controlled. Adults at the 75th percentile
    of gamma-tocopherol had 2.8-3.4 years greater cellular aging than those at the
    25th percentile, depending on the covariates in the model. However, alpha-tocopherol
    was not related to telomere length. Evidently, gamma-tocopherol levels, but not
    alpha-tocopherol, account for meaningful increases in biological aging.

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Previous research has shown a significant association between
    weight and telomere length, but did not take into consideration weight range.
    The study was to investigate the association of weight range with telomere length.
    METHODS: Data of 2918 eligible participants aged 25-84 years from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000 cycle were analyzed.
    Information about demographic variables, lifestyle factors, anthropometric variables,
    and medical comorbidities were included. Univariate and multivariate linear regression
    model with adjustments for potential confounders were employed to determine the
    association between weight range and telomere length. A non-parametrically restricted
    cubic spline model was used to illustrate the possible non-linear relationship.
    RESULTS: In univariate linear regression, BMI(max), BMI range, and weight range
    all revealed significant negative associations with telomere length. However,
    annual rate of BMI/weight range showed a significant positive associations with
    telomere length. There was no significant association between telomere length
    and BMI(min). After adjusting for potential confounders, the inverse associations
    persisted in BMI(max) (β=-0.003, P{\textless}0.001), BMI range (β=-0.002, P=0.003),
    and weight range (β=-0.001, P=0.001). Furthermore, annual rate of BMI range (β=-0.026,
    P=0.009) and weight range (β=-0.010, P=0.007) presented negative associations
    with telomere length, after adjusting for covariates in Model 2-4. The association
    between BMI(min) (β =-0.002, P=0.237) and telomere length still could not reach
    statistical significance in multivariate linear regression model. The results
    of restricted cubic spline analysis showed that BMI(max) (P for nonlinear =0.026),
    BMI range (P for nonlinear =0.022), weight range (P for nonlinear =0.035), annual
    rate of BMI range (P for nonlinear =0.030), and annual rate of weight range (P
    for nonlinear =0.027) all had nonlinear inverse associations with telomere length.
    CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that weight range is inversely associated with
    telomere length in U.S. adults. Larger weight fluctuation may accelerate telomere
    shortening and aging.'

- abstract: 'The relationship between fiber intake and telomere length was evaluated
    using a cross-sectional design and an NHANES sample of 5674 U.S. adults. Another
    purpose was to test the impact of potential confounders on the association. Fiber
    consumption was measured using a 24 h recall and telomere length was indexed using
    the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Overall, the U.S. adults had
    low fiber intake (median: 6.6 g per 1000 kcal)-less than one-half the recommendation
    of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. With age, gender, race, housing status,
    and misreported energy intake controlled, the relationship between fiber intake
    per 1000 kcal and telomere length was linear (F = 9.5, p = 0.0045). Specifically,
    for each 1 g increment in fiber intake per 1000 kcal, telomeres were 8.3 base
    pairs longer. Because each additional year of chronological age was associated
    with telomeres that were 15.5 base pairs shorter, results suggest that a 10 g
    increase in fiber intake per 1000 kcal would correspond with telomeres that are
    83 base pairs longer. On average, this would equate to 5.4 fewer years of biologic
    aging (83 ÷ 15.5). With smoking, BMI, alcohol use, and physical activity controlled,
    as well as the other covariates, each 10 g increment in fiber accounted for telomeres
    that were 67 base pairs longer (F = 7.6, p = 0.0101), a biologic aging difference
    of about 4.3 years. In conclusion, significant fiber consumption accounts for
    longer telomeres and less biologic aging than lower levels of fiber intake.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: A higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with shorter
    telomeres. The loss of muscle mass with aging is associated with adverse outcomes.
    The appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI) is currently used to quantify muscle
    mass. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of the ASMI with leukocyte telomere
    length in adult Americans. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 dataset. Body composition
    was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Low muscle mass was defined
    using sex-specific thresholds of the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI).
    The telomere-to-single-copy gene ratio (T/S ratio) was converted to base pairs.
    Generalized linear models were performed to evaluate the association of ASMI with
    telomere length. RESULTS: In multivariable adjustment regression models, higher
    ASMI was associated with longer telomeres in US adults (β = 70.2, P {\textless}
    0.001, P trend{\textless}0.001). In participants with preserved muscle mass, the
    ASMI was related to longer telomere length (β = 75.1, P {\textless} 0.001), but
    not significantly in low muscle mass participants (β = 68.7, P = 0.30). Further
    subgroup analysis by a combination of age groups and muscle mass status showed
    positive association with young-preserved muscle mass (β = 82.6, P {\textless}
    0.001), old-preserved muscle mass (β = 44.4, P = 0.12), young-low muscle mass
    (β = 135.4, P = 0.20), and old-low muscle mass (β = 52.7, P = 0.55). Because each
    additional year of chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 15.3
    base pairs shorter, on average, this would equate to 5.4 fewer years of biological
    aging (82.6 ÷ 15.3) in the young-preserved muscle mass participants. CONCLUSIONS:
    A higher ASMI is associated with longer telomeres. The prevention of skeletal
    muscle loss has the potential to delay telomere shortening and account for less
    biological aging.'

- abstract: Metabolic syndrome is a chronic and complex disease characterized by environmental
    and genetic factors. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study
    assessed the relationship between exposure to a mixture of environmental chemicals
    and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and further examined whether telomere length (TL)
    moderated these relationships. A total of 1265 adults aged {\textgreater} 20 years
    participated in the study. Data on multiple pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
    phthalates, and metals), MetS, leukocyte telomere length (LTL), and confounders
    were provided in the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
    The correlations between multi-pollutant exposure, TL, and MetS in the males and
    females were separately assessed using principal component analysis (PCA), logistic
    and extended linear regression models, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR),
    and mediation analysis. Four factors were generated in PCA that accounted for
    76.2\% and 77.5\% of the total environmental pollutants in males and females,
    respectively. The highest quantiles of PC2 and PC4 were associated with the risk
    of TL shortening (P {\textless} 0.05). We observed that the relationship between
    PC2, PC4, and MetS risk was significant in the participants with median TL levels
    (P for trend = 0.04 for PC2, and P for trend = 0.01 for PC4). Furthermore, mediation
    analysis revealed that TL could explain 26.1\% and 17.1\% of the effects of PC2
    and PC4 associated with MetS in males, respectively. The results of BKMR model
    revealed that these associations were mainly driven by 1-PYE (cPIP = 0.65) and
    Cd (cPIP = 0.29) in PC2. Meanwhile, TL could explain 17.7\% of the mediation effects
    of PC2 associated with MetS in the females. However, the relationships between
    pollutants and MetS were sparse and inconsistent in the females. Our findings
    suggest that the effects of the risk of MetS associated with mixed exposure to
    multiple pollutants are mediated by TL, and this mediating effect in the males
    is more pronounced than that in the females.

- abstract: 'AIM: The present investigation was designed to test the association between
    leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and two simple markers of insulin resistance,
    that is, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and triglyceride-glucose
    (TyG) index in U.S. adults without metabolic diseases. METHODS: A total of 6489
    U.S. adults without diabetes from NHANES 1999-2002 were analyzed. TyG index was
    calculated as ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2].
    HOMA-Index was calculated as fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) × fasting serum insulin
    (mU/mL)/22.5. LTL was obtained using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction
    method. Multivariate linear regression analysis was assessed to evaluate the association
    of TyG index HOMA-IR with LTL. We further conducted a generalized additive model
    (GAM) and a fitted smoothing curve with penalized spline method. RESULTS: It was
    found that the mean LTL was 5796.1 bp in the measured healthy adults. Overall,
    TyG index was significantly associated with LTL, while HOMA-IR was not. Compared
    with participants in tertile 1 of the TyG index, the β (95\% CI) for those in
    the second (8.27 to 8.77) and third (≥ 8.77) were -4.31 (95\% CI: -48.12{\textasciitilde}39.49)
    and -95.98 (95\% CI: -145.08{\textasciitilde}-46.89), respectively. Subjects with
    TyG index ≥ 8.77 had statistically significant shorter LTL (β = -93.33, 95\%CI:
    -134.33{\textasciitilde}-52.32), compared with TyG index {\textless} 8.77. We
    further explored a dose-response relation between TyG index by a decile approach
    [≤ 7.81 (reference), 7.81-8.04, 8.04-8.21, 8.21-8.37, 8.37-8.52, 8.52-8.68, 8.68-8.83,
    8.83-9.03, 9.03-9.33, and {\textgreater}9.33] and LTL. Five subgroups (TyG index
    7.81-8.04, 8.04-8.21, 8.21-8.37, 8.37-8.52, and 8.52-8.68) did not show significant
    effect on LTL; while there was a significantly shorter LTL for participants with
    the TyG index {\textgreater} 8.68, supporting a threshold effect of TyG index
    on LTL. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that higher TyG index ({\textgreater}
    8.68) was closely related to shorter LTL and the TyG index was better associated
    with LTL than HOMA-IR.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Age-at-menopause and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) are
    both associated with biologic aging. Therefore, it would be reasonable to hypothesize
    that LTL may also serve as a marker for reproductive aging as shorter LTL may
    be associated with earlier age-at-menopause. METHODS: We analyzed data from 799
    post-menopausal (ages 41-85) participants in the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (1999-2002), a nationally representative sample of U.S. women.
    RESULTS: Controlling for behavioral, socio-demographic, and health-related determinants
    of menopause, we found that among non-Hispanic white women, an increase of one
    standard deviation in LTL was associated with a 0.43 year higher reported age-at-menopause.
    Among Mexican-Americans, an increase of one standard deviation in LTL was associated
    with a 1.56 year earlier menopause. There was no significant association between
    LTL and age-at-menopause among non-Hispanic black women. CONCLUSIONS: Our main
    finding is evidence of a strong interaction by race/ethnicity in the association
    between LTL and age-at-menopause. This evidence does not support the hypothesis
    that shorter LTL is a predictor of earlier age-at-menopause, as the magnitude
    and direction of the associations between LTL and age-at-menopause varied across
    racial/ethnic groups.'

- abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused
    by multiple potential contributing factors such as bacterial biofilm infection
    of the tissues surrounding the teeth and environmental determinants and a dysregulated
    host response for modifying and resolving the inflammation. Because periodontal
    disease is a major public health concern with substantial increases in the prevalence
    and severity in aging populations, previous studies of periodontitis tended to
    approach the disease as an age-associated outcome across the life span. However,
    few investigations have considered that, as a chronic noncommunicable disease,
    periodontitis may not simply be a disease that increases with age but may contribute
    to more rapid biologic aging. OBJECTIVES: Increasing population data supports
    the potential disconnect between chronological aging and biologic aging, which
    would contribute to the heterogeneity of aging phenotypes within chronologic ages
    across populations. Thus, our aim was to test whether periodontal disease affects
    biological aging across the life span. METHODS: The prevalence of periodontitis
    in the adult US population is a portion of the assessment of the National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which has been ongoing since 1971 through
    2-y cycles sampling populations across the country. We used NHANES 2001-2002 to
    test the hypothesis that the presence/severity of periodontal disease as an exposure
    variable would negatively affect telomere length, a measure of biological aging,
    and that this relationship is modified by factors that also affect the progression
    of periodontitis, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking. RESULTS: The data
    demonstrated a significant impact of periodontitis on decreasing telomere lengths
    across the life span. These differences were modulated by age, sex, race/ethnicity,
    and smoking within the population. CONCLUSION: The findings lay the groundwork
    for future studies documenting broader effects on biological aging parameters
    as well as potential intervention strategies for periodontitis in driving unhealthy
    aging processes. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory
    disease and dysregulated host response. Shortening of telomeres is a reflection
    of biologic aging. Decreased telomere lengths with periodontitis are seemingly
    related to chronic infection and persistent local and systemic inflammation. These
    findings suggest that periodontitis is not simply a disease of aging but may also
    transmit chronic systemic signals that could affect more rapid biological aging.
    Clinicians can use this outcome to recognize the role of periodontitis in driving
    unhealthy aging processes in patients.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Telomere length (TL) serves as a pivotal gauge of cellular
    aging, with shorter TL linked to various age-related ailments. Recently, a DNA
    methylation-based TL estimator, known as DNAmTL, has emerged as a novel TL measurement
    tool. Our current investigation scrutinized the correlation between DNAmTL and
    the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and enduring mortality among middle-aged
    and elderly individuals. METHODS: We enrolled a nationwide, population-based cohort
    of subjects from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey spanning
    1999 to 2002, possessing data on both DNAmTL and quantitative polymerase chain
    reaction-based TL (qPCRTL). Logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazards
    models were employed to evaluate the associations of DNAmTL with CVD risk and
    mortality, respectively. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 2532 participants, with
    a weighted CVD prevalence of 19.06\%. Notably, each one-kilobase increase in DNAmTL
    was linked to a 53\% diminished CVD risk [odds ratio (OR): 0.47, 95\% confidence
    interval (CI): 0.23-0.95, P = 0.035]. Over a median follow-up period of 206 months,
    1361 deaths were recorded (53.75\%), with 590 (23.30\%) ascribable to CVD. Individuals
    with the lengthiest DNAmTL exhibited a 36\% lower risk of all-cause mortality
    (hazard ratio (HR): 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.49-0.85, P = 0.002) and a 35\% decrease in
    CVD mortality (HR: 0.65, 95\% CI: 0.43-0.98, P = 0.044) compared to those with
    shortest DNAmTL. Notably, a stronger association with age was observed for DNAmTL
    compared to qPCRTL (r = -0.58 vs. r = - 0.25). Analysis of receiver operating
    characteristic (ROC) curves suggested superior predictive performance of DNAmTL
    over qPCRTL for CVD (area under curve (AUC): 0.63 vs. 0.55, P {\textless} 0.001),
    all-cause (AUC: 0.74 vs. 0.62, P {\textless} 0.001), and CVD mortality (AUC: 0.75
    vs. 0.64, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Longer DNAmTL was positively correlated
    with reduced CVD risk and long-term mortality in middle-aged and elderly cohorts.
    Notably, DNAmTL outperformed qPCRTL as an aging biomarker in the stratification
    of CVD risks and mortality.'

- abstract: Telomere length is closely linked to biological aging, oxidative stress,
    and the development of cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to assess the
    association between dietary selenium intake and telomere length in individuals
    with hypertension. Data on dietary selenium intake were captured through the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) computer-assisted dietary interview
    system (CADI). Telomere length determination entailed selecting blood samples
    from all participants in the NHANES database. The analysis was performed using
    Analysis System software, with Empower stats utilized for data analysis. Results
    showed that there was a significant association between dietary selenium intake
    and telomere length in hypertension, particularly within the female group. In
    female hypertension cases, a 1 mcg increase in dietary selenium intake corresponded
    to a telomere length increase of 1.19 bp, even after adjusting for age, race,
    BMI, marital status, physical activity, energy intake, and stroke history. The
    relationship between dietary selenium intake and telomere length exhibited a linear
    pattern in female hypertension patients. This study identified a positive association
    between dietary selenium intake and telomere length in hypertension, particularly
    within the female group.

- abstract: 'Se is an indispensable trace element for the human body, and telomere
    length is considered a marker of biological ageing. Previous studies have shown
    that dietary Se intake is associated with telomere length. However, the relationship
    between Se intake and telomere length in patients with diabetes has not been well
    studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between dietary
    Se intake and telomere length in patients with diabetes. We extracted 878 participants
    with diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database
    for 1990-2002. Dietary Se intake was assessed using the 24 h dietary recall method,
    and telomere length was measured using quantitative PCR. Generalised linear models
    were constructed to assess the relationship between dietary Se intake and telomere
    length. After controlling for the confounders, 1 μg increase in dietary Se intake
    in female patients with diabetes, and telomere length increased by 1·84 base pairs
    (β = 1·84 (95 \% CI: 0·15, 3·53)), there was a line relationship between dietary
    Se intake and telomere length in female patients with diabetes and telomere length
    increased with increasing dietary Se intake within the range of 0-250 μg. The
    study demonstrates that dietary Se intake is significantly associated with telomere
    length only in the female population with diabetes in the USA. However, further
    prospective studies are required to confirm this finding.'

    adulthood with leukocyte telomere length among U.S. adults. METHODS: This study
    included 3,886 subjects aged 36-75 years from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 cycle. Survey-weighted multivariable linear
    regression with adjustments for potential confounders was utilized. RESULTS: 3,386
    individuals were finally included. People with stable obesity had a 0.130 kbp
    (95\% CI: 0.061-0.198, P=1.97E-04) shorter leukocyte telomere length than those
    with stable normal weight (reference group) during the 10-year period, corresponding
    to approximately 8.7 years of aging. Weight gain from non-obesity to obesity shortened
    the leukocyte telomere length by 0.094 kbp (95\% CI: 0.012-0.177, P=0.026), while
    normal weight to overweight or remaining overweight shortened the leukocyte telomere
    length by 0.074 kbp (95\% CI: 0.014-0.134, P=0.016). The leukocyte telomere length
    has 0.003 kbp attrition on average for every 1 kg increase in weight from a mean
    age of 41 years to 51 years. Further stratified analysis showed that the associations
    generally varied across sex and race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: This study found
    that weight changes during a 10-year period was associated with leukocyte telomere
    length and supports the theory that weight gain promotes aging across adulthood.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the
    major health issues worldwide. Pathophysiological changes in COPD are mainly reflected
    in the deterioration of lung function with aging. METHODS: Considering that telomere
    length is a hallmark of biological aging, we first performed a meta-analysis to
    summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between telomere length
    and COPD and then employed individual-level data from the continuous National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate whether telomere
    length could reflect accelerated aging in COPD and serve as an independent predictor.
    A mediation study was further performed to examine whether the association between
    telomeres and COPD could be mediated by inflammation, as one of the most important
    etiologies and characteristics of COPD. RESULTS: The four studies included in
    our meta-analysis were with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 95.7\%, P(het) {\textless}
    0.001), and the pooled relative risk for COPD comparing the shortest tertile versus
    the longest tertile was 4.06 (95\% CI = 1.38 to 11.96). Of the 6,378 subjects
    in the individual-level data analyses using NHANES, 455 were diagnosed with COPD,
    and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression also indicated that short telomere
    length was associated with COPD. Consistently, cubic regression spline analyses
    showed that long telomeres exhibited a significant association with a decreased
    risk of COPD. In the subsequent mediation analyses, C-reactive protein concentration,
    white blood cells count and blood neutrophil count, as inflammatory biomarkers,
    showed a significant indirect effect on the relationship between telomere length
    and COPD. CONCLUSION: Accelerated aging in COPD could be characterized by excessive
    telomere shortening, and inflammatory response might be involved in the underlying
    mechanisms of COPD pathogenesis promoted by short telomere length. Telomere length
    measurement may facilitate clinical translational research and targeted therapy
    of COPD.'

    This study explored the relationship between time spent jogging or running each
    week and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in 4458 randomly selected U.S. adults.
    The association was studied using data collected by the National Health and Nutrition

    time was calculated from survey responses. From the minute totals, three categories
    were formed: {\textless}10 min/week, 10-74 min/week, and ≥75 min/week. Adults
    in the third category met the U.S. guidelines. Data were analyzed using one-way
    ANOVA. Partial correlation was used to adjust for differences in potential mediating
    factors, including demographic and lifestyle/medical factors. In the total sample,
    after adjusting for all the potential covariates, mean LTL significantly differed
    across the three jog/run categories (F = 4.1, p = 0.0272). Specifically, adults
    who met the guidelines via jogging and/or running had significantly longer telomeres
    than adults who performed no jogging/running. Adults in the middle category did
    not differ from the other two categories. A minimum of 75 min of jogging/running
    weekly is predictive of longer telomeres when compared to adults who do not jog
    or run regularly.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggested that lifestyle factors including
    dietary habits may influence the telomere length which is a reliable marker of
    biological aging and predictor for chronic diseases. However, the role of dietary
    selenium intake in telomere length maintenance is rarely examined. OBJECTIVE:
    We aimed to test the relationship between dietary selenium intake and telomere
    length among middle-aged and older adults in America. METHODS: A total of 3194
    United States adults older than 45 years old were extracted from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. Leukocyte
    telomere length was measured using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain
    reaction (qPCR). Dietary selenium intake was assessed by a trained interviewer
    using 24-h dietary recall method. Generalized linear models were performed to
    evaluate the association of dietary selenium intake with telomere length. The
    restricted cubic spline analysis was used to further explore the nonlinear dose-response
    relationship between dietary selenium intake and telomere length. RESULTS: After
    adjusting potential confounders, every 20 μg increase in dietary selenium intake
    was associated with 0.42\% (95\% CI: 0.02\%, 0.82\%) longer telomere length in
    all participants. In the subgroup analyses, dietary selenium intake was related
    to longer telomere length in females (Percentage change: 0.87\%; 95\% CI: 0.26\%,
    1.49\%) and non-obese participants (Percentage change: 0.53\%; 95\% CI: 0.04\%,
    1.02\%), but not in males (Percentage change: 0.04\%; 95\% CI: -0.49\%, 0.57\%)
    and obese participants (Percentage change: 0.21\%; 95\% CI: -0.47\%, 0.91\%).
    The restricted cubic spline analysis showed a linear association between dietary
    selenium intake and telomere length. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the
    increased dietary selenium intake was associated with longer telomere length among
    middle-aged and older adults in America. These findings require further corroboration
    from future prospective studies.'

- abstract: The role of dietary macronutrients and energy intake in the aging process
    has been well-established. However, previous research has mainly focused on the
    association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and individual macronutrients,
    while the effects of macronutrient composition on LTL remain unclear. This cross-sectional
    analysis involved 4130 US adults (44.8 ± 17.0 years; 51\% female) from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1999-2002. A single 24-h dietary
    recall is used to collect dietary data. The relationship between dietary macronutrient
    composition and LTL is examined using three-dimensional generalized additive models.
    After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, physical activity, BMI, and
    dietary quality, a three-dimensional association of macronutrient composition
    with LTL (P = 0.02) is revealed. Diets lower in protein (5-10\%), higher in carbohydrates
    (75\%), and lower in fat (15-20\%) are associated with the longest LTL corresponding
    to 7.7 years of slower biological aging. Diets lowest in protein (5\%) and carbohydrate
    (40\%), while highest in dietary fat (55\%) are associated with the shortest LTL,
    corresponding to accelerated biological aging of 4.4 years. The associations appeared
    magnified with higher energy intake. These findings support a complex relationship
    between dietary macronutrients and biological aging independent of diet quality.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Dietary habits and dietary intake affect telomere length,
    a reliable marker of biological aging and a predictor of chronic disease. Riboflavin
    (RF) is known as a water-soluble antioxidant vitamin, but its role in telomere
    length maintenance has yet to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study
    was to examine the relationship between dietary RF intake and telomere length
    in a nationally representative sample of adults. METHODS: Using the NHANES (1999-2002),
    telomere data of 4,298 participants aged ≥45 years were analyzed in a cross-sectional
    manner. Leukocyte telomere length was measured using the quantitative real-time
    polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Dietary RF intake was assessed by a trained
    interviewer using 24-h dietary recall method. Generalized linear regressions were
    performed to evaluate the association between dietary RF intake and telomere length.
    Subgroup analyses were performed to further explore this relationship in sex and
    body mass index (BMI) subgroups. RESULTS: Among the 3,788 participants included,
    the average telomere length was longer in females (P = 0.014), while they had
    a lower average RF intake compared to males (P {\textless} 0.001). There was a
    weak positive correlation between RF intake and telomere length both when unadjusted
    (β = 0.011; P = 0.037) and adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity (β = 0.013; P
    = 0.033). Subgroup analyses showed a positive association between RF intake and
    the telomere length in female after adjusting for confounding factors (β = 0.029;
    P = 0.046). In the female subgroup, there were significant positive relationships
    between telomere length and RF intake in the obese group (β = 0.086, P = 0.022).
    CONCLUSION: Increased dietary RF intake was significantly associated with longer
    telomere length in middle-aged and older American females, especially in low RF
    intake obese female.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as
    dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may influence leukocyte
    telomere length (LTL), a biomarker associated with chronic disease. In vitro research
    suggests dioxins may bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and induce telomerase
    activity, which elongates LTL. However, few epidemiologic studies have investigated
    associations between POPs and LTL. OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between
    18 PCBs, 7 dioxins, and 9 furans and LTL among 1,330 U.S. adults from NHANES 2001-2002.
    METHODS: We created three summed POP metrics based on toxic equivalency factor
    (TEF), a potency measure including affinity for the AhR: a) non-dioxin-like PCBs
    (composed of 10 non-dioxin-like PCBs; no AhR affinity and no TEF); b) non-ortho
    PCBs (composed of 2 non-ortho-substituted PCBs with high TEFs); and c) toxic equivalency
    (TEQ) (composed of 7 dioxins, 9 furans, 2 non-ortho-substituted PCBs, and 6 mono-ortho-substituted
    PCBs; weighted by TEF). We tested the association between each metric and LTL
    using linear regression, adjusting for demographics, blood cell count and distribution,
    and another metric with a different TEF (i.e., non-ortho PCBs and TEQ adjusted
    for non-dioxin-like PCBs; non-dioxin-like PCBs adjusted for non-ortho PCBs). RESULTS:
    In adjusted models, each doubling of serum concentrations of non-ortho PCBs and
    TEQ was associated with 3.74\% (95\% CI: 2.10, 5.40) and 5.29\% (95\% CI: 1.66,
    9.05) longer LTLs, respectively. Compared with the lowest quartile, the highest
    quartile of exposure was associated with 9.16\% (95\% CI: 2.96, 15.73) and 7.84\%
    (95\% CI: -0.53, 16.92) longer LTLs, respectively. Non-dioxin-like PCBs were not
    associated with LTL. CONCLUSIONS: POPs with high TEFs and AhR affinity were associated
    with longer LTL. Because many dioxin-associated cancers are also associated with
    longer LTL, these results may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying PCB-
    and dioxin-related carcinogenesis. CITATION: Mitro SD, Birnbaum LS, Needham BL,

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Telomere length can be a biomarker of cumulative oxidative
    stress and inflammation indicating biological aging. Previous studies examined
    association of nutrient intake with telomere length targeting middle-aged and
    elderly individuals. This study examined whether dietary macro- and micronutrient
    intake was associated with telomere length in young females. METHODS: Seventy-four
    Japanese young females (median (interquartile range) age was 19 (19 - 20) years)
    participated. We estimated their intake of nutrients (energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate,
    essential elements, vitamins, fatty acids, and dietary fibre) using a semi-quantitative
    food frequency questionnaire and measured telomere length (T/S ratio, the ratio
    of telomere repeat copy number (T) to single-copy gene number (S)) of DNA extracted
    from blood by qPCR. The association between telomere length and tertiles of nutrient
    intake were analysed. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) of telomere length
    was 0.70 (0.52 - 0.98). Vitamin A intake was positively associated with telomere
    length (tertile 1 vs. 2, coefficient [95\% confidence interval] = 0.42 [0.12,
    0.71]; tertile 1 vs. 3, coefficient [95\% confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.04, 0.62])
    after adjusting for covariates (age, BMI, passive smoking, and drinking). CONCLUSIONS:
    Our findings suggest that variation in vitamin A intake might influence telomere
    attrition in healthy individuals.'

    aging. Whether telomere erosion coincides with age-related increases in antinuclear
    antibody (ANA) seropositivity remains unknown. Our study aimed to determine the
    association between ANA seropositivity and shortened telomeres among 1999-2002
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) subjects. METHODS: We
    performed a cross-sectional analysis of 2,188 NHANES study participants with available
    ANA and telomere length data. ANA testing was performed using indirect immunofluorescence.
    Telomere lengths were measured via quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods.
    Applying appropriate sample weighting techniques, we used univariate and multivariate
    logistic regression methods to assess the association between shortened telomeres
    (i.e. lowest decile of the cohort) and ANA seropositivity. RESULTS: ANAs were
    positive in 322 out of 2,188 (14.7\%, 95\% CI 13.3-16.3\%) individuals. Subjects
    with shortened telomeres were more likely to be older (p{\textless}0.001), male
    (p=0.005), and have a cancer history (p{\textless}0.001). A higher proportion
    of non-Hispanic white participants (61.6\% vs. 49.3\%) and a lower proportion
    of non-Hispanic black participants (7.8\% vs. 17.9\%) had shortened telomeres
    (p{\textless}0.001). Shortened telomeres were not independently associated with
    ANA seropositivity (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 0.87-2.52, p=0.14). However, female sex (OR
    1.91, 95\% CI 1.23-2.96, p=0.006), age ≥80 years (OR 2.06, 95\% CI 1.08-3.92,
    p=0.03), and African American race (OR 1.58, 95\% CI 1.00-2.51, p=0.05) were independent
    risk factors for ANA seropositivity. Neither sex nor race modified the relationship
    between ANA seropositivity and telomere length. CONCLUSIONS: Telomere erosion
    does not appear to be responsible for age-related increases in the prevalence
    of ANA seropositivity.'

- abstract: 'Background: Recent studies have suggested a link between reproductive
    health and later-life chronic conditions, yet the mechanism remains unclear. One
    proposed mechanism is through chronic inflammation. The objective of this study
    was to examine the association between endometriosis and uterine fibroids and
    biomarkers of inflammation and cellular aging. Materials and Methods: We used
    data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2342; 1999-2002).
    Adjusted logistic and linear regression were used to examine the association between
    these two reproductive conditions and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; {\textgreater}3.0
    mg/L) and leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio), respectively. Given that a greater
    length of time spent with a condition may represent persistence of an inflammatory
    process, we further examined the association between time since disease diagnosis
    on telomere length among the subset of women with diagnosed endometriosis and
    fibroids. Results: Women with endometriosis had greater odds of having elevated
    CRP than those without endometriosis (OR = 1.60; 95\% CI: 1.05 to 2.45). Women
    with endometriosis had a shorter telomere length than women without endometriosis
    (-3.4, 95\% CI: -7.3 to -0.3 in age-adjusted models and -2.9, 95\% CI: -8.8 to
    3.5 in fully adjusted models). Telomeres were 1\% (95\% CI: -1.2 to -0.6) shorter
    for every elapsed year since endometriosis diagnosis. No substantive patterns
    emerged between uterine fibroids and CRP or telomere length. Conclusions: Women
    with endometriosis (or a longer duration of time spent with endometriosis) had
    higher inflammatory markers and shorter mean telomere length. These results provide
    further insights into potential mechanisms linking endometriosis to chronic disease
    and later-life health.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Organophosphate insecticides have been widely used for {\textgreater}30
    years, and are reported to be associated with various age-related chronic diseases.
    While shortening of telomere length has been considered as a marker of cellular
    aging, only a few small studies have been conducted to examine any difference
    of telomere length in workers exposed to organophosphates versus controls. Epidemiologic
    studies of the dose-response associations between environmental organophosphate
    exposure and telomere length in the general population are few. OBJECTIVE: This
    study aimed to evaluate the association between levels of organophosphate insecticide
    exposure and telomere length in the general population. METHODS: We analyzed data
    for 1724 participants aged 20 years or more from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey 1999-2002. Organophosphate insecticide exposure was estimated
    using measures of urinary concentrations for 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY)
    and six non-specific dialkyl phosphate metabolites, e.g., diethyl thiophosphate
    (DETP). Multiple linear regression was conducted to assess the association between
    organophosphate exposure and telomere length. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic
    and physical factors and urinary creatinine, participants in the second quartile
    for urinary TCPY had 0.06 (95\% CI: 0.02-0.10) T/S ratio shorter telomere length
    than those in the lowest quartile. By contrast, participants in the second and
    third tertiles of urinary DETP had 0.08 (95\% CI: 0.02-0.14) and 0.06 (95\% CI,
    0.01-0.11) T/S ratio longer telomere length than those in the lowest tertile.
    For other five metabolites, there was no association with telomere length. CONCLUSIONS:
    Levels of environmental exposures to certain organophosphate insecticides may
    be linked to altered telomere length in adults in the general population. Although
    our findings may need to be replicated, we provide the first evidence that environmental
    exposure to organophosphates may contribute to the alteration of telomere length,
    which is potentially related to biological aging and to the development of various
    chronic diseases.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Dietary micronutrients are significantly associated with
    telomere length, as shown in multiple studies. However, no study has investigated
    the association between magnesium intake and telomere length in adults with hypertension.
    METHODS: Participants were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. Dietary magnesium intake was assessed
    using the 24 - hour recall method and the telomere length of leukocytes was measured
    using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A multivariate regression model was then
    used to assess the association between dietary magnesium intake and telomere length
    in adults with hypertension. RESULTS: Our final analysis included 2199 hypertensive
    adults (46.79\% males) with a mean dietary magnesium intake of 254.82±133.47 mg/day.
    Linear regression, adjusted for race, sex, age, smoking, uric acid, and other
    variables, showed that every 1 mg increase in dietary magnesium intake was associated
    with a 0.20 (95\% CI: 0.01, 0.39, p = 0.043) longer telomere length in all participants.
    In the ≥45 years age group, there was a statistically significant association
    between the telomere length and dietary magnesium (95\% CI: 0.16, 0.63, p {\textless}0.001).
    CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that increased magnesium intake is associated
    with a longer telomere length in hypertensive adults, especially in those ≥45
    years of age. However, further research is needed to determine a causal relationship.'

- abstract: 'STUDY OBJECTIVES: Data on the association between snoring and telomere
    length, an indicator of biological aging, are very limited. Moreover, no polysomnography
    (PSG) studies on this association in a general population have been conducted.
    Our study aimed to evaluate the association between snoring and leukocyte telomere
    length (LTL) using PSG and a questionnaire. METHODS: A cross-sectional PSG study
    embedded in a population-based cohort from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study
    was conducted in 2010-2013. During the same period, questionnaire-based interviews,
    blood collection, and relative LTL assays were conducted. A total of 887 Korean
    men and women aged 50-79 y with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) {\textless} 15 determined
    in the PSG study were included in the study. RESULTS: We observed that the percentage
    of time spent snoring during sleep (\% time spent snoring) assessed by PSG was
    inversely associated with LTL even after adjusting for potential risk factors
    and AHI. In the linear regression association between tertiles of percentage of
    time spent snoring and log-transformed LTL, coefficient estimates (P value) were
    -0.076 ({\textless} 0.05) for the second tertile and -0.084 ({\textless} 0.01)
    for the third tertile compared with the bottom tertile. When LTL was compared
    according to snoring status determined using PSG and questionnaire information,
    both primary snorers and those with mild sleep apnea (5 ≤ AHI {\textless} 15)
    had shorter LTL than nonsnorers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that snoring
    may influence telomere attrition independent of sleep apnea.'

- abstract: 'STUDY QUESTION: Is telomere length related to parity among a nationally
    representative sample of US reproductive age women? SUMMARY ANSWER: History of
    live birth was associated with shorter telomere length. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY:
    Shorter telomeres have been linked with a range of chronic health conditions and
    mortality and parity has been associated with health indicators. However, there
    is a lack of research on how parity relates to telomere length. STUDY DESIGN,
    SIZE, DURATION: This nationally representative, cross-sectional study included
    1954 women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002,
    the only survey period which includes measurement of telomere length. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS,
    SETTING, METHODS: Women aged 20-44 were included. Parity, defined as number of
    previous live births, was ascertained by questionnaire. Leukocyte telomere length
    was measured by polymerase chain reaction and reported as a ratio in relation
    to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). The relationship between leukocyte T/S
    ratio and parity was examined using survey weighted linear regression. Models
    were adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, BMI, income-to-poverty ratio, education,
    early age at menarche and smoking status. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE:
    Among reproductive age women in the US, the adjusted mean leukocyte T/S ratio
    was 4.2\% (95\% CI: 0.9, 7.3) shorter in parous compared with nulliparous women.
    Parity was associated with 116 fewer base pairs (95\% CI: 26, 204) on average,
    using estimated coefficients from the adjusted linear regression models and mean
    covariate values. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was cross-sectional
    and therefore was unable to establish temporality. The dataset lacked information
    on social factors, stress and fertility status, which may help explain these findings.
    Only two previous studies have examined this question and our findings should
    be interpreted with caution. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings
    in a nationally representative sample of US reproductive age women suggest that
    history of live birth may be associated with accelerated cellular aging. The magnitude
    of the observed association was greater than that of the impact of smoking or
    obesity on telomere length, suggesting that parity may have an independent influence
    on cellular aging and warrant further study. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S):
    The study was funded in part by the Undergraduate Research Scholars Program at
    George Mason University. The authors have no conflicts of interest. TRIAL REGISTRATION

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sex hormone concentrations and telomere length
    are age related responses of human body, while whether there is a direct relation
    between sex hormone and telomere length is uncertain. Therefore, we used the data
    of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to quantify their
    direct association. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 710 women aged 35-60
    years and 539 men aged 20-85 years were included from two cycles of the NHANES
    (1999-2002). Telomere length relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio) was
    measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Seven hormones in
    serum (5 in men and 2 in women) were assayed. Logistic regressions were used to
    calculate the odds ratios to evaluate the telomere length-sex hormones association.
    RESULTS: Men with vigorous physical activity (71.1\%) and without history of cardiovascular
    diseases, diabetes, and lipid-lowering drugs using tended to have a longer telomere
    length (all P-values {\textless} 0.05); while women with longer sedentary time,
    smaller pregnant or live birth, and with older ages of firth/last birth were likely
    with longer telomere length (all P-values {\textless} 0.05). After adjusted for
    potential confounders, only anti-Mullerian hormone was positively and stably associated
    with short leukocytes telomere length in men (OR: 1.098; 95\% CI: 1.034, 1.165).
    We did not detect any significant association of short telomere length with sex
    hormones in men and women. Discussion and Implications: Serum anti-Mullerian hormone
    in men was positively and stably associated with telomere length. More large-scaled
    and well-designed prospective studies are warranted to reconfirm our conclusions.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To explore the independent associations of sedentary behavior
    and physical activity with telomere length among Chinese adults. METHODS: Data
    on total time of sedentary behavior, screen-based sedentary behavior (including
    television watching and computer or phone use), moderate to vigorous physical
    activity, and dietary intake of 518 adults in Chengdu, Guizhou, and Xiamen in
    China (54.25\% women) aged 20 to 70 years were obtained between 2013 and 2015
    through questionnaires. Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured
    to calculate body mass index and percentage of body fat. Telomere length was measured
    through Southern blot technique. RESULTS: Television watching was inversely related
    to adjusted telomere length (-71.75 base pair; SE = 34.40; P = .04). Furthermore,
    a similar trend between telomere length and television watching was found in the
    group aged 20 to 40 years after adjusting for all covariates. Adults aged 20 to
    40 years in the highest tertile of daily time spent on watching television had
    4.0\% shorter telomere length than adults in the lowest tertile (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS:
    Although the association is modest, television watching is inversely related to
    telomere length among Chinese adults, warranting further investigation in large

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Consumption of nuts and seeds is associated favorably with
    all-cause mortality. Nuts and seeds could reduce disease and prolong life by influencing
    telomeres. Telomere length is a good indicator of the senescence of cells. The
    purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between nuts and
    seeds intake and leukocyte telomere length, a biomarker of biologic aging. DESIGN:
    Cross-sectional. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,582 randomly selected
    men and women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
    1999-2002, were studied. MEASUREMENTS: DNA was obtained via blood samples. Telomere
    length was assessed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. A
    validated, multi-pass, 24-h recall dietary assessment, administered by NHANES,
    was employed to quantify consumption of nuts and seeds. RESULTS: Nuts and seeds
    intake was positively and linearly associated with telomere length. For each 1-percent
    of total energy derived from nuts and seeds, telomere length was 5 base pairs
    longer (F=8.6, P=0.0065). Given the age-related rate of telomere shortening was
    15.4 base pairs per year (F=581.1, P{\textless}0.0001), adults of the same age
    had more than 1.5 years of reduced cell aging if they consumed 5\% of their total
    energy from nuts and seeds. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of nuts and seeds accounts
    for meaningful decreases in biologic aging and cell senescence. The findings reinforce
    the recommendations of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourage
    the consumption of nuts and seeds as part of a healthy diet.'

- abstract: Telomere length (TL) has been associated with age-related health outcomes.
    We investigated the relationship of TL with cardiometabolic risk profile in adult
    Americans. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for 1999
    to 2002, accounting for complex sampling and survey design. Of the 8892 eligible
    participants, 47.8\% (n = 4123) were men. Mean serum high-density lipoprotein
    cholesterol concentrations significantly increased across increasing TL quarters
    ( P = .013), and mean fat mass, fat-free mass, hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and
    C-reactive protein significantly decreased across increasing TL quarters (all
    P {\textless} .001) in men. Only HbA(1c) levels significantly decreased across
    increasing TL quarters ( P = .041) in women. Males in the upper quarter of TL
    had lower (38\%) odds of prevalent metabolic syndrome compared with those in the
    lower quarter ( P {\textless} .001). These results support the hypotheses that
    cardiometabolic factors are related to TL, especially in men.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The aetiology of diabetes is complex with limited treatment
    strategies. Growing animal studies have shown that targeted antiageing can improve
    the outcomes of diabetes. However, population evidence is limited. This study
    aims to evaluate the associations of biological ageing with all-cause and cause-specific
    mortality among people with diabetes. METHODS: A total of 5278 people with diabetes
    from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2014 were included.
    Biological ageing was measured from different perspectives, including phenotypic
    age, biological age, telomere length and klotho concentration. Phenotypic/biological
    age acceleration was the residual resulting from a linear model when regressing
    phenotypic/biological age on chronological age. Cox proportional hazards models
    were used to examine the relationships between ageing and all-cause, cardiovascular
    disease (CVD), and cancer mortality. RESULTS: Over median follow-up for 7.3 years,
    1355 diabetics died. There was a positive and linear association of mortality
    with phenotypic age acceleration (HR(all-cause) 1.04; HR(CVD) 1.04; HR(cancer)
    1.04, p{\textless}0.001) and biological age acceleration (HR(all-cause) 1.03;
    HR(CVD) 1.04; HR(cancer) 1.03, p{\textless}0.001). Telomere length was inversely
    associated with all-cause mortality (tertile (T)3 vs T1: HR 0.67, p{\textless}0.05).
    The concentration of klotho had a U-shaped relationship with mortality (T2 vs
    T1: HR(all-cause) 0.62; HR(CVD) 0.48; HR(cancer) 0.47, p{\textless}0.05). Further,
    stratified analysis by age and sex found that the associations of ageing-related
    markers with mortality were more significant in the aged and female subgroup.
    CONCLUSIONS: Biological ageing was positively associated with mortality among
    people with diabetes, indicating therapies targeting antiageing could be encouraged
    to halt the progression of diabetes.'

    intake and coffee consumption and leukocyte telomere length, a biomarker of the
    senescence of cells. METHODS: A total of 5826 adults from the National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were studied cross-sectionally. Using
    the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method, telomere length was compared
    to standard reference DNA. Caffeine intake from foods and beverages and coffee
    consumption were measured using a validated, multi-pass, computer-assisted, 24-h
    recall system administered by NHANES interviewers. The following covariates were
    controlled: age, gender, race, marital status, education, housing, smoking, BMI,
    physical activity, alcohol use, and coffee intake (or caffeine consumption). RESULTS:
    Caffeine consumption was inversely related to telomere length (F = 15.1, P = 0.0005).
    For each 100 mg of caffeine consumed, telomeres were 35.4 base pairs shorter,
    after adjusting for the covariates. For each 100 mg of caffeine consumed among
    coffee drinkers only, telomeres were 36.7 base pairs shorter (F = 9.0, P = 0.0054),
    and among non-coffee drinkers only, 40.0 base pairs shorter (F = 8.5, P = 0.0067).
    Conversely, coffee intake was positively related to telomere length (F = 12.6,
    P = 0.0013), independent of the covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that
    caffeine consumption accounts for shorter telomeres in U.S. adults, independent
    of numerous covariates, whereas coffee intake predicts longer telomeres.'

    stress. The association between telomere length shortening and migraine, along
    with potential age-related influences, has not been comprehensively studied. This
    cross-sectional study included data from 6169 participants in the National Health
    and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2002, encompassing information on peripheral
    blood leukocyte telomere length, severe headache or migraine, and potential confounders.
    Stratifying by age (20-50 years, {\textgreater} 50 years), we employed multivariable
    logistic regression, restricted cubic splines and interaction test to investigate
    age-influenced telomere length in relation to migraine. In participants aged 20-50
    years, the odds ratio (OR) for migraine in the shortest telomere length group
    T1 (0.39-0.89) was 1.35 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 1.01, 1.79) compared
    to the longest group T3 (1.10-9.42), whereas in those aged {\textgreater} 50 years,
    the OR of T1 was 0.93 (95\% CI 0.60, 1.43). Additionally, telomere length and
    age interacted in the development of migraine (p for interaction: 0.010). In individuals
    aged 20-50, an L-shaped relationship was found between telomere length and migraine,
    with an inflection point at 1.02T/S ratio. The OR was 9.34 (95\% CI 1.56, 55.99)
    for telomere lengths {\textless} 1.02T/S ratio. These findings suggest age influences

- abstract: 'Background: Acculturation profiles and their impact on telomere length
    among foreign-born Hispanics/Latinos living in the United States (US) are relatively
    unknown. The limited research available has linked acculturation with shortened
    telomere length. Objectives: To identify acculturation profiles among a US representative
    sample of Hispanics/Latinos and to then examine telomere length differences between
    profiles. Methods: We conducted a latent class analysis among a non-institutionalized
    US-representative sample of Hispanics/Latinos using the 1999-2002 National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2,292). The latent variable of acculturation
    was assessed by length of time in the US and language used as a child, read and
    spoken, usually spoken at home, used to think, and used with friends (i.e., Spanish
    and/or English). Telomere length assessed from leukocytes was used as the distal
    continuous outcome. Results: We identified five profiles: (1) low acculturated
    [33.2\% of sample]; (2) partially integrated [18.6\% of sample]; (3) integrated
    [19.4\% of sample]; (4) partially assimilated [15.1\% of sample]; and (5) assimilated
    [13.7\% of sample]. Acculturation profiles revealed nuanced differences in conditional
    probabilities with language use despite the length of time spent in the US. While
    telomere length did vary, there were no significant differences between profiles.
    Conclusion: Profiles identified revealed that possible life-course and generational
    effects may be at play in the partially assimilated and assimilated profiles.
    Our findings expand public health research using complex survey data to identify
    and assess the dynamic relationship of acculturation profiles and health biomarkers,
    while being among the first to examine this context using a person-centered approach.'

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: Telomere length is a biomarker of cellular ageing, with longer
    telomeres associated with longevity and reduced risk of chronic disease in older
    age. Consumption of a healthy diet may contribute to longevity via its impact
    on cellular ageing, but studies on diet and telomere length to date have been
    limited and their findings equivocal. The aim of this study was to examine associations
    between three indices of diet quality and telomere length in older men and women.
    METHODS: Adults aged 57-68 years participating in the Wellbeing, Eating and Exercise
    for a Long Life (WELL) study in Victoria, Australia (n = 679), completed a postal
    survey including an 111-item food frequency questionnaire in 2012. Diet quality
    was assessed via three indices: the Dietary Guideline Index, the Recommended Food
    Score, and the Mediterranean Diet Score. Relative telomere length was measured
    by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Associations between diet quality and
    telomere length were assessed using linear regression adjusted for covariates.
    RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, physical activity,
    and body mass index (BMI), there were no significant associations between diet
    quality and relative telomere length. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of older adults
    residing in Victoria, Australia, men and women aged 57-68 years with better-quality
    diets did not have longer telomeres. Further investigation in longitudinal studies
    will determine whether diet can influence telomere length over time in an ageing
    population.'

- abstract: Accelerated telomere attrition is related to various diseases, and multiple
    factors have been reported to influence telomere length. However, little attention
    has focused on the relationship between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere
    length. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between serum
    phosphate levels and mean telomere length in the US general population. A total
    of 7,817 participants from the 1999-2002 NHANES were included. The association
    between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere length was investigated using
    regression models. A remarkably positive relationship between serum phosphate
    levels and mean telomere length emerged after adjustments were made for covariates.
    The adjusted β coefficient of serum phosphate levels for mean telomere length
    was 0.038 (95\% confidence intervals (CIs), 0.022 to 0.095, p = 0.002). A longer
    telomere length was observed in participants with serum phosphate levels in the
    highest quartiles, and a dose-dependent association was observed. Our study demonstrated
    that higher quartiles of phosphate had a remarkable correlation with longer telomere
    length.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that environmental exposures and behaviour
    influence telomere length, an indicator of cellular ageing. We systematically
    associated 461 indicators of environmental exposures, physiology and self-reported
    behaviour with telomere length in data from the US National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2002. Further, we tested whether factors identified
    in the NHANES participants are also correlated with gene expression of telomere
    length modifying genes. METHODS: We correlated 461 environmental exposures, behaviours
    and clinical variables with telomere length, using survey-weighted linear regression,
    adjusting for sex, age, age squared, race/ethnicity, poverty level, education
    and born outside the USA, and estimated the false discovery rate to adjust for
    multiple hypotheses. We conducted a secondary analysis to investigate the correlation
    between identified environmental variables and gene expression levels of telomere-associated
    genes in publicly available gene expression samples. RESULTS: After correlating
    461 variables with telomere length, we found 22 variables significantly associated
    with telomere length after adjustment for multiple hypotheses. Of these varaibales,
    14 were associated with longer telomeres, including biomarkers of polychlorinated
    biphenyls([PCBs; 0.1 to 0.2 standard deviation (SD) increase for 1 SD increase
    in PCB level, P {\textless} 0.002] and a form of vitamin A, retinyl stearate.
    Eight variables associated with shorter telomeres, including biomarkers of cadmium,
    C-reactive protein and lack of physical activity. We could not conclude that PCBs
    are correlated with gene expression of telomere-associated genes. CONCLUSIONS:
    Both environmental exposures and chronic disease-related risk factors may play
    a role in telomere length. Our secondary analysis found no evidence of association
    between PCBs/smoking and gene expression of telomere-associated genes. All correlations
    between exposures, behaviours and clinical factors and changes in telomere length
    will require further investigation regarding biological influence of exposure.'

    cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to explore the association
    between LTL and CVD risk in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.
    Complex associations, including nonlinearity and interaction, were also examined.
    A total of 7,378 subjects from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    (NHANES) 1999-2002 were collected. Telomere length was detected from DNA samples
    and expressed as the mean T/S ratio (telomere repeats per single-copy gene). We
    performed multiple logistic regression models and interactive analysis to explore
    the associations between LTL and CVD risk by adjusting for potential confounders.
    We also performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate the robustness of our
    results. Among all participants, LTL was associated with the risk of CVD (OR =
    0.79, 95\% CI: 0.63{\textasciitilde}0.98, P = 0.033) in a linear manner rather
    than in a nonlinear manner (P = 0.874). Interaction effects of LTL with both education
    (P = 0.017) and hypertension (P = 0.007) were observed. Furthermore, using subgroup
    analyses, protective effects of LTL on CVD risk were found in females and in individuals
    who were college graduates or above, had serum cotinine {\textgreater}10 ng/ml,
    did not have hypertension, or had normal white blood cell levels. LTL is linearly

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: Telomere length is a biomarker for aging. It is known that oxidative
    stress can accelerate telomere shortening, whereas antioxidants can delay their
    shortening. Carotenoids as antioxidants are favorably associated with health-
    and aging-related diseases caused by oxidative stress, but their association with
    telomere length is less certain. We investigated the association between blood
    carotenoid levels and leukocyte telomere length in a representative sample of
    US adults. METHODS: We analyzed 3660 participants aged 20 years and older in the
    1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The levels of carotenoids-alpha-carotene,
    beta-carotene (trans + cis), beta-cryptoxanthin, combined lutein/zeaxanthin, and
    trans-lycopene-were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The
    leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio) was assayed using the quantitative polymerase
    chain reaction method. RESULTS: A doubling of blood alpha-carotene, beta-carotene
    (trans + cis), and beta-cryptoxanthin was associated with approximately 2 \% longer
    telomeres. Compared with the lowest carotenoid quartile of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene
    (trans + cis), and beta-cryptoxanthin, telomere length for adults with the highest
    quartiles was significantly increased by 5-8 \%. CONCLUSION: We found that increasing
    levels of blood carotenoid were significantly associated with longer leukocyte
    telomeres in US adults. High intake of carotenoid-rich food may play a role in
    protecting telomeres and regulating telomere length.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Telomeres are long hexamer (TTAGGG) repeats at the ends of
    chromosomes, and contribute to maintenance of chromosomal stability. Telomere
    shortening has been linked to cancers and other chronic diseases in adults, although
    evidence for causal associations is limited. The aim of this study was to determine
    whether nutritional factors are associated with telomere length (TL) in children.
    METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of nutritional factors and TL in
    437 children between 2009 and 2011. Healthy children ages 3, 6, and 9 y provided
    blood samples, and their parents completed a food frequency questionnaire and
    a telephone interview about relevant environmental exposures. TL and blood micronutrient
    levels were measured, and genotyping at 10 loci was undertaken. Associations between
    the micronutrients and other variables were assessed using linear regression.
    RESULTS: No significant main or interactive effects of age or sex were seen. After
    adjustment for age, sex, parental education, and month of blood collection, TL
    was inversely associated with plasma zinc, and shorter in children with the homozygous
    mutant genotype of the RFC G80A (rs1051266) polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: To the
    best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the association between
    telomere length and micronutrients in healthy children. The reason for the inverse
    relationship of TL with zinc is unknown but could be the result of an increase
    in telomere sequence deletions caused by labile zinc induction of oxidative stress.
    These findings should be corroborated in other studies before nutritional recommendations
    might be considered.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The evidence on the association between cobalamin (Cbl) and
    aging or relevant outcomes is limited and controversial. We aimed to investigate
    the relationships between cobalamin intake- and function-related biomarkers and
    biological aging. METHODS: The study encompassed 22,812 participants aged 20 years
    and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A panel of
    biomarkers or algorithms was used to assess biological aging, including Klemera-Doubal
    Age Acceleration (KDMAccel), Phenotypic age acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel), telomere
    length, α-Klotho, and PhenoAge advancement. Weighted generalized linear regression
    analysis was used to assess the associations between cobalamin-intake biomarkers
    (serum cobalamin, cobalamin intake from food, cobalamin supplement use, serum
    methylmalonic acid [MMA], and homocysteine [Hcy]) and function-related biomarkers
    (functional cobalamin deficiency and cobalamin insensitivity index). RESULTS:
    Among the 22,812 individuals, the weighted mean (SE) age was 48.3 (0.2) years
    and 48.0\% were males. Unexpectedly, serum and dietary cobalamin as well as serum
    MMA and Hcy levels were positively associated with most indicators of biological
    aging. Cobalamin sensitivity was assessed by the combination of binary Cbl(low/high)
    and MMA(low/high) or Hcy(low/high) (cutoff values: 400 pg/mL for cobalamin, 250
    nmol/L for MMA, and 12.1 μmol/l for Hcy) and a newly constructed cobalamin insensitivity
    index (based on the multiplicative term of serum cobalamin and serum MMA or Hcy).
    The multivariable-adjusted β (95\%CIs) of KDMAccel in the MMA(low)Cbl(low), MMA(low)Cbl(high),
    MMA(high)Cbl(low), and MMA(high)Cbl(high) groups were reference, 0.27 (0.03 to
    0.51), 0.85 (0.41 to 1.29), and 7.97 years (5.77 to 10.17) respectively, which
    were consistent for the combination of serum Hcy and cobalamin. Both cobalamin
    insensitivity indices were robustly associated with biological aging acceleration
    in a dose-response pattern (each p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased
    cobalamin sensitivity but not cobalamin insufficiency might be associated with
    biological aging acceleration. Further studies would improve understanding of
    the underlying mechanisms between decreased cobalamin sensitivity and biological
    aging acceleration.'

    age, cardiovascular risk and chronic medical conditions. Few studies have focused
    on the association between telomere length (TL) and kidney function. OBJECTIVE:
    We investigated the association between TL and kidney function/prevalent chronic
    kidney disease (CKD) in US adults. METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) participants with measured data on kidney function
    and TL from 1999 to 2002 were included. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
    was based on CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Urinary albumin
    excretion was assessed using urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). We used multivariable
    adjusted linear and logistic regression models, accounting for the survey design
    and sample weights. RESULTS: Of the 10568 eligible participants, 48.0\% (n=5020)
    were men. Their mean age was 44.1 years. eGFR significantly decreased and ACR
    significantly increased across increasing quarters of TL (all p{\textless}0.001).
    The association between TL and kidney function remained robust even after adjusting
    for potential confounding factors, but the association between TL and ACR was
    only borderline significant (β-coefficient= -0.012, p=0.056). CONCLUSION: The
    association of kidney function with a marker of cellular senescence suggests an
    underlying mechanism influencing the progression of nephropathy.'

    procedures, and most hysterectomies are performed for benign indications. Despite
    the frequency and known benefits of the procedure, it remains unclear whether
    it has potential adverse effects on long-term health and longevity. The aim of
    this study was to evaluate the association of age at benign hysterectomy with
    leukocyte telomere length, in data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2002. STUDY DESIGN: In total, 811 women who had a
    hysterectomy were included in this cross-sectional study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
    To estimate the association of age at benign hysterectomy with telomere length,
    multivariate regression analyses adjusted for age, race/ ethnicity, education,
    marital status, income poverty ratio, body mass index (BMI), physical activity,
    smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, history of chronic disease and history
    of oophorectomy were conducted. Fitted smoothing curves were also evaluated. RESULTS:
    We found leukocyte telomere length was positively correlated with age at benign
    hysterectomy after adjusting for other confounders in both a minimally adjusted
    model [β = 4.18, 95\%CI: (0.17,8.20)] and a fully adjusted model [β = 4.63, 95\%
    CI:(0.56,8.70)]. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier age at benign hysterectomy was associated
    with shorter telomere length in a nationally representative population of women.
    These data provide new information in pre-surgical counseling and decision-making.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND \& AIM: Telomere length and telomerase have been linked with
    cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the impact of telomere length
    on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and advanced fibrosis in a large national
    population sample is not well understood. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 were utilized. Suspected
    nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed if serum alanine aminotransferase
    was {\textgreater}30 IU/L for men and {\textgreater}19 IU/L for women in the absence
    of other causes of chronic liver disease. Presence of advanced fibrosis was determined
    by the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score, aspartate aminotransferase
    to platelet ratio index and FIB-4 score. RESULTS: Of the 6738 participants (mean
    age 46.3 years, 48.4\% male), suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease prevalence
    was inversely associated with leucocyte telomere length in young adults aged 20-39
    years, though this was not seen in the overall population. Percentage of participants
    with advanced fibrosis increased corresponding with leucocyte telomere length
    (longest to shortest). The shortest quartile of leucocyte telomere length was
    associated with a significantly higher odds ratio (95\% confidence interval) of
    advanced fibrosis of 2.36 (1.32-4.24) in a univariate model compared to the longest
    quartile, and 2.01 (1.13-3.58) in a multivariate model adjusted for age, gender,
    ethnicity, waist circumference, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, total cholesterol
    and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P for trend {\textless}.05 respectively).
    CONCLUSIONS: In this large nationally representative sample of American adults,
    leucocyte telomere shortening was associated with increased risk of advanced fibrosis
    in the setting of suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease independent of other
    known risk factors.'

    length (LTL) with all-cause, cardiovascular (CVD)- and cancer-specific mortality
    risks among U.S. adults; and whether these associations vary with race and ethnicity
    and age. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort using data from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 to 2002 and the 2015 Linked Mortality
    File on adults 25 years or older (n = 6,526 and 1,753 deaths). Cox proportional

    adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. We
    tested a three-way interaction for LTL, race and ethnicity, and age groups. RESULTS:
    After adjustment, the rate of dying for all-cause and CVD-specific mortality was
    at least 24\% lower for a 1 kilobase increase in LTL. When compared with adults
    with the shortest telomere, the rates of dying were at least 17\% lower for all-cause
    and CVD-specific mortality for those with longer telomere. For all-cause mortality,
    increase LTL was associated with lower rate of dying among non-Hispanic Blacks
    45 years or older, and non-Hispanic Whites 65 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: We
    found that increase telomere length was associated with lower all-cause and CVD-specific
    mortality rates among U.S. adults. For all-cause mortality, this association varies
    within racial and ethnic groups across age groups.'

- abstract: Little is known about the associations of inflammation and depression
    with telomere length. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002, the current study assessed the effects of inflammation
    and depression on telomere length in 1141 young adults in the USA. Depression
    status was assessed from the World Health Organization Composite International
    Diagnostic Interview and inflammation status was measured based on C-reactive
    protein (CRP) concentrations. Information on telomere length was obtained using
    the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method to measure telomere length relative
    to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Unadjusted and adjusted linear and logistic
    regression models were used to assess the relationship between the tertiles of
    CRP concentration and the telomere length stratified by the status of depression
    such as major depression or depressed affect vs. no depression. The adjusted models
    were controlled for age, family poverty income ratio, race/ethnicity, marital
    status, physical activity, body mass index, and alcohol drinking status. A significant
    and decreasing linear trend in telomere length was found as CRP levels increased
    in men, regardless of the depression status, and women with major depression or
    depressed affect (p values {\textless} 0.05). Among men without depression, those
    with an elevated CRP level had increased odds of having a shortened telomere length
    compared to men with low CRP levels after controlling for covariates (adjusted
    odds ratio 1.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.90). In women, there was
    no association between CRP and telomere length, regardless of the depression status.
    In conclusion, there was a significant and inverse association between inflammation
    and telomere length according to the depression status in men but not in women.
    The present findings may be of clinical significance for the monitoring of inflammation
    levels and depression status as determinants of telomere length.

- abstract: Telomere length, a biomarker of human aging, is related to adverse health
    outcomes. Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress and inflammation contributes
    to telomere shortening, whereas social support may protect from telomere shortening.
    Despite sex differences in telomere length and social support, little is known
    about whether there are sex differences in the relationship between oxidative
    stress/inflammation and telomere length, and sex-specific moderating roles of
    social support in older adults. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002, this study assessed whether the associations
    between oxidative stress/inflammation and telomere length vary with sex and explored
    social support as a moderator in these associations among 2289 older adults. Oxidative
    stress was measured based on serum Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and inflammation
    was measured based on C-reactive protein (CRP). After adjusting for the covariates,
    GGT was significantly associated with telomere length in females only (β = - 0.037,
    95\% CI = - 0.070, - 0.005), while CRP was associated with telomere length in
    males only (β = - 0.019, 95\% CI = - 0.035, - 0.002). Moreover, high social support
    mitigated the negative association between GGT and telomere length, which was
    more evident in females. Furthermore, social support moderated the association
    between CRP and telomere length in males aged 70 and above. Our findings indicated
    that biological mechanisms related to telomere length may vary with sex, while
    social support plays a sex-specific moderating role.

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate whether there is a direct, age-independent association
    between telomere length and visual acuity decline in a large community-based cohort
    study. METHODS: Participants older than 40 with linked leukocyte telomere length
    (LTL) were enrolled in NHANES. LTL was assayed using qPCR from the participants''
    blood samples. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the better-seeing eye was
    analyzed, with visual impairment (VI) defined as BCVA ≥ 20/40. LTL was grouped
    into quartiles, and its association with BCVA and VI was evaluated after adjusting
    for covariates. RESULTS: Among the 4,480 enrolled participants, the weighted means
    of age, BCVA, and telomere length were 56.1 ± 11.9 years, 0.05 ± 0.08 logMAR,
    and 5,662 ± 36 base pairs, respectively. The proportion of VI was 2.6\%. After
    adjusting for covariates including sex, ethnicity, education, family poverty income
    ratio, general health status, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and body mass index,
    BCVA was significantly worse in participants with shorter LTL, with a significant
    trend (p = 0.002). However, after further adjusting for age, the association between
    LTL and BCVA was no longer significant, without a trend (p = 0.640). No significant
    association or trend between LTL and VI was found in the stepwise logistic model.
    CONCLUSIONS: No age-independent association between LTL and BCVA was found. Our
    study indicates LTL may not serve as a biomarker for age-related visual acuity
    decline.'

- abstract: The relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and telomere length
    was examined using a cross-sectional design and an NHANES random sample of 5448
    U.S. adults. Fruit and vegetable (F\&V) consumption was assessed using a 24 h
    recall, and telomere length, an index of cellular aging, was measured using the
    quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Telomere length was linearly related
    to F\&V intake when combined (F = 22.7, p {\textless} 0.0001) and also when separated
    as fruit (F = 7.2, p {\textless} 0.0121) or vegetables (F = 15.4, p {\textless}
    0.0005), after adjusting for covariates. Specifically, telomeres were 27.8 base
    pairs longer for each 100 g (3.5 ounces) of F\&V consumed. Because each additional
    year of chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 14.9 base pairs
    shorter, when women and men were analyzed together, results indicated that a 100
    g (3.5 oz) per day increment in F\&V corresponded with 1.9 years less biological
    aging. When the 75th percentile of F\&V intake was compared to the 25th, the difference
    was 4.4 years of cellular aging. When separated by sex, fruits and vegetables
    were both related to telomere length in women, but only vegetable intake was predictive
    of telomere length in men. In conclusion, evidence based on a random sample of
    U.S. adults indicates that the more the servings of F\&V, the longer telomeres
    tend to be.

- abstract: Preliminary evidence suggests that sex steroid hormones, such as danazol
    (a synthetic sex steroid hormone), may be involved in enhancing telomerase activity.
    Elucidating underlying mechanisms of telomerase activity may further therapeutic
    options for individuals with telomeropathies and potentially avert certain age-related
    conditions. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the
    relationship between circulating sex steroid hormones and SHBG with leukocyte
    telomere length among 499 males in NHANES (1999-2002 surveys). Sample-weighted
    linear regression analyses were conducted to assess age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted
    estimates of associations. Estimates were rescaled to represent telomere length
    change in base pairs per half the value of the interquartile range of the independent
    variable. Estradiol and free estradiol were significantly inversely associated
    with leukocyte telomere length (β(continuous per §)(IQR)( ) = -61, p = 0.04; free
    estradiol β(continuous per §)(IQR)( ) = -67, p = 0.03). Testosterone, free testosterone,
    androstanediol glucuronide, and SHBG were not associated with leukocyte telomere
    length. The inverse association seen in this study indicates that a danazol-induced
    hypoestrogenic state could partly underlie the previously observed association
    between danazol therapy and increased leukocyte telomere length.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Although telomere length has a significant relationship with
    various age-related diseases, studies on its relationship with hearing status
    in adults are limited and equivocal. This study investigated the associations
    between mean telomere length (MTL) and low-, speech-, and high-frequency hearing
    threshold shifts of adults in the United States. METHODS: A total of 2,027 adults,
    aged 20-69 years, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES,
    1999-2002) were included in the analytic sample. The quantitative polymerase chain
    reaction method was used for the MTL assay, and MTL was expressed using the telomere-to-single
    copy gene (T/S) ratio. Hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone average (PTA) for
    the better ear at ≥ 20 dB HL at frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz. Univariate
    and multivariate linear regression analyses and smooth curve fittings were conducted
    to evaluate the correlation between MTL and low-, speech-, and high-frequency
    hearing levels. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 40.60 ± 12.76 years,
    including 952 men (weighted, 48.67\%) and 303 (weighted, 12.88\%) participants
    with hearing loss. After adjusting for potential confounders in the multivariate
    linear regression model, the relationship between MTL and hearing thresholds was
    not statistically significant. Smooth curve fittings indicated a non-linear relationship
    between MTL and high-frequency PTA hearing threshold shifts. MTL was inversely
    related to high-frequency PTA to the turning point (T/S ratio = 0.82) (adjusted
    β-21.45, 95\% CI -37.28, -5.62; P = 0.008). When the T/S ratio exceeded0.82, MTL
    was not associated with high-frequency PTA (adjusted β0.18, 95\% CI -2.21, 2.57;
    P = 0.8809). CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that MTL was associated with high-frequency
    PTA hearing threshold shifts of adults in the United States in a non-linear manner.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker
    of biologic age. Whether food security status modulates LTL is still unknown.
    We investigated the association between food security and LTL in participants
    of the 1999-2002 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
    METHODS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate the association
    between food security categories and LTL controlling for sex, race, and education
    and accounting for the survey design and sample weights. RESULTS: We included
    10,888 participants with 5228 (48.0\%) being men. They were aged on average 44.1
    years. In all, 2362 (21.7\%) had less than high school, 2787 (25.6\%) had achieved
    high school, while 5705 (52.5\%) had done more than high school. In sex-, race-,
    and education-adjusted ANCOVA, average LTL (T/S ratio) for participants with high
    food security versus those with marginal, low, or very low food security was 1.32
    versus 1.20 for the age group 25-35 years and 1.26 versus 1.11 for the 35-45 years,
    (p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: The association between food insecurity and
    LTL shortening in young adults suggest that some of the future effects of food
    insecurity on chronic disease risk in this population could be mediated by telomere
    shortening.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental stressors can lead to shorter leukocyte
    telomere length and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Preservation of leukocyte
    telomere length by reducing oxidative stress exposure and reinforcing immunity
    may be a mechanism by which nutritional factors delay or prevent chronic disease
    development. METHODS: Healthy pregnant women (aged 18-45 years) at 9-15 weeks
    of gestation living in Gasabo District, Kigali, Rwanda, were recruited from 10
    health centers for a prospective, longitudinal study from September to October
    2017 to determine possible associations between nutrition health, infectious disease
    and leukocyte telomere length. Anthropometric and laboratory measurements were
    performed using standard procedures; sociodemographic parameters and health histories
    were assessed via surveys, and leukocyte telomere length was assessed using quantitative
    PCR expressed as the ratio of a telomeric product to a single-copy gene product
    (T/S). RESULTS: Mean gestational age of participants (n = 297) at enrollment was
    13.04 ± 3.50 weeks, age was 28.16 ± 6.10 years and leukocyte telomere length was
    1.16 ± 0.22 (T/S). Younger age; no schooling vs. primary schooling; and lower
    levels of ferritin, soluble transferrin receptors and retinol-binding protein
    were independent predictors of longer telomere length in multivariable models.
    CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte telomere length is an indicator of biological aging in
    pregnant Rwandan women. Maternal micronutrient status, specifically lower ferritin,
    soluble transferrin receptor levels, and retinol-binding protein levels were associated
    with longer maternal telomere length in contrast with some studies from North
    America and Europe. There were no associations between inflammation and infectious
    disease status and maternal leukocyte telomere length. Further studies are needed
    to enhance our understanding of the interplay between maternal nutritional status
    and infectious disease in relation to leukocyte telomere length in developing
    countries.'

    roles in genomic integrity, DNA double-strand break repair, cell cycle checkpoint
    activation, telomere maintenance, and meiotic recombination. The risk allele of
    RAD50 may negatively affect cancer by reducing the DNA repair capacity. Additionally,
    Sodium intake and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection are major risk factors
    for gastric cancer (GC). Our study investigated the association between polymorphisms
    in RAD50 gene and the risk of GC case-fatality. We evaluated whether the association
    differed with sodium intake or H. pylori infection. METHODS: We enrolled 490 patients
    from two hospitals between 2002 and 2006. Their survival or death was prospectively
    followed up until December 31, 2016, through a review of medical records and telephone
    surveys. The GC survival was assessed using the Cox proportional hazards regression
    analysis. RESULTS: In 319 GC cases, the total person-years were 1928.3, and the
    median survival years was 5.4 years. A total of 137 GC deaths were recorded. Our
    fully adjusted model showed that the GG type of RAD50 rs17772583 polymorphism
    is significantly associated with an increased risk of GC case-fatality (hazard
    ratio [HR] = 2.20, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-3.77) compared to that
    associated with the homozygous AA type. In the high sodium intake group, patients
    with the GG type of RAD50 rs17772583 showed a significantly higher GC case-fatality
    (HR = 8.61, 95\% CI = 2.58-26.68) than that of patients with homozygous AA type.
    In the positive-H. pylori infection group, patients with GG-type RAD50 rs17772583
    showed a significantly higher GC case-fatality (HR = 10.11, 95\% CI = 2.81-36.35)
    than that of with AA homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GG-type RAD50 rs17772583,
    high sodium intake, or a positive-H. pylori infection are at a significantly increased
    risk of GC case-fatality compared to that associated with the absence of these
    risk factors.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Planetary Health Diet (PHD) is a novel dietary pattern
    proposed by the EAT-Lancet Commission in 2019, yet a limited study has investigated
    the anti-aging effects of PHD to date. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore
    the association between adherence to PHD, as quantified by the Planetary Health
    Diet Index (PHDI), and biological aging in American populations. METHODS: Data
    were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
    for 1999-2018. Food consumption information was relied on two 24-h diet recall
    questionnaires. The biological aging condition was comprehensively assessed by
    four biological markers, including phenotypic age, biological age, telomere length,
    and klotho concentration. Weighted multivariate linear models, restricted cubic
    spline (RCS), and subgroup analysis were subsequently carried out to evaluate
    the influence of PHDI on biological aging. RESULTS: 44,925 participants with complete
    data were finally enrolled in our study. The fully adjusted models showed decreased
    0.20 years in phenotypic age [-0.20 (-0.31, -0.10)] and declined 0.54 years in
    biological age [-0.54 (-0.69, -0.38)] correlated with PHDI per 10 scores increment.
    Klotho concentration [6.2 (1.0, 11.0)] was positively related to PHDI. In Model
    2, telomere length increased by 0.02 bp for every 10-point rise in PHDI. Besides,
    the RCS analysis results exhibited a curvilinear relationship between PHDI and
    four indicators. CONCLUSION: Our study explored a significant correlation between
    PHDI and biological aging, indicating that adherence to PHD may prevent biological
    aging.'

    aging and is associated with several diseases, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors.
    OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to verify whether food insecurity is associated with
    shorter telomere length in older people. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study
    carried out in a municipality in the interior of Brazil, with a sample of 440
    older people from the community. For telomere length analysis, a blood sample
    was obtained from each participant, followed by real-time qPCR, and sociodemographic
    and health information was collected through interviews. Food security/insecurity
    was measured using the reduced version of the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale.
    Descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression were performed to analyze
    the factors associated with shorter telomere length, adopting a significance level
    of 5\%. RESULTS: We found that food insecurity was significantly associated with
    shorter telomere length, regardless of age group, skin color, tabagism, physical
    activity, milk and dairy consumption, living arrangement, and basic activities

- abstract: 'SCOPE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an important biomarker of aging.
    This study examined whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the
    Dietary Inflammatory Index(TM) (DII) has an impact on telomere shortening in the
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We also carried out
    validation of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Data
    came from NHANES 1999-2002. LTL and CRP were assayed from leukocyte DNA and serum
    specimens, respectively. The DII was calculated from food intakes assessed using
    24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 calories consumed. Associations were
    examined using survey-based multivariable linear regression for log-transformed
    LTL. After multivariable adjustment, higher DII scores (i.e. relatively more pro
    inflammatory) were associated with shorter LTL both when used as continuous (b
    = -0.003; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = -0.005, -0.0002) and as quartiles (b(DIIquartile4vs1)
    = -0.013; 95\% CI = -0.025, -0.001; P(trend) = .03). In this same sample the DII
    also was associated with CRP ≥3 mg/L (OR(DIIcontinuous) = 1.10; 95\% CI = 1.06,
    1.16). CONCLUSION: In these NHANES data there was an association between DII and
    LTL. This study also provided a successful construct validation of the DII using
    CRP in a nationally representative sample. These results are consistent with the
    hypothesis that diet-associated inflammation determines LTL.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The joint effect of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and type
    2 diabetes (T2D) on the risk of all-cause death has been sparsely explored. The
    study designed to examine the joint effect of T2D and LTL on the probability of
    death in American adults. METHODS: A cohort of 6862 adults with LTL measurements
    and with or without T2D from the NHANES 1999-2002 with follow-up information until
    2015 was studied. Quantitative PCR was used to measure the length of telomeres
    relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Individuals were grouped into
    three tertiles according to the LTL levels, with the first tertile demonstrating
    the lowest one and used as the reference group. The effects of LTL and T2D status
    on death were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves along with log-rank test. Three
    Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for various confounders were used
    to examine the links between TL and all-cause death possibility using adjusted
    hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Adults in the sample averaged 45.54 years of age,
    with 49.51\% being male. After a median follow-up period of 14.4 years, 1543 (22.5\%)
    individuals died from all cause. The probability of all-cause mortality was higher
    among individuals with LTL in the highest tertile than individuals in the lowest
    tertile (aHR = 0.89; 95\%CI: 0.77-1.03); however, the difference did not reach
    the level of statistical significance (P = 0.11). Conversely, the individuals
    with T2D had a higher probability of death than individuals without (aHR = 1.26;
    95\%CI: 1.06-1.50; P = 0.0092). When LTL and T2D status were investigated jointly,
    subjects in the highest TLT tertile and with T2D had the highest probability of
    mortality compared with their counterparts (aHR = 1.34; 95\%CI: 1.07-1.68; P =
    0.0101). However, there was no independent effect of low TLT on mortality as demonstrated
    among individuals with diabetes (aHR = 1.14; 95\%CI: 0.95-1.38; P = 0.1662). CONCLUSION:
    The joint effect of TLT and T2D was larger than the sum of the independent effects
    on the risk of all-cause death. Participants with high TLT and diabetes showed
    the highest possibility of death compared with other groups.'

- abstract: 'Chronic pain is a common condition associated with psychological distress,
    functional impairments, and age-associated comorbidity. Preliminary studies, on
    the basis of relatively small sample sizes, suggest that the combination of chronic
    pain and stress is associated with telomere shortening, a widely recognized marker
    of cellular aging. We sought to determine the cross-sectional association of chronic
    pain with telomere length in 7,816 community-dwelling adults ages 20 years and
    older who participated in the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey. Consistent with previous studies, leukocyte telomere length was assessed
    using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method and compared with a DNA
    reference standard to compute a telomere to single copy gene ratio. Standardized,
    in-person interviews were used to identify chronic regional pain and chronic widespread
    pain in 784 (10.0\%) and 266 (3.4\%) participants, respectively. Older age, male
    sex, obesity, and less physical activity were associated with shorter telomere
    length (P {\textless}.05 for all comparisons); however, there was no association
    of chronic pain with telomere length. The age-adjusted means (standard error)
    of telomere length telomere to single copy gene ratios were 1.04 (.02), 1.03 (.02),
    and 1.02 (.02) in participants with no chronic pain, chronic regional pain, and
    chronic widespread pain, respectively (P = .69). In addition, chronic pain did
    not modify the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, or psychological
    distress on telomere length. In summary, chronic regional and widespread pain
    were not associated with telomere length in this nationally representative study;
    however, we could not determine associations of pain duration and severity with
    telomere length because of limitations in pain assessment data. PERSPECTIVE: The
    findings from the current study do not support the hypothesis that chronic pain
    accelerates cellular aging measured according to leukocyte telomere length. Additional
    population-based studies with more detailed assessments of pain and stress are
    needed to further investigate potential interactive effects on telomere length
    and other biomarkers of aging.'

- abstract: 'CONTEXT: Both obesity and inflammation are related to accelerated aging.
    It is not yet known whether inflammation mediates the effects of obesity on aging.
    OBJECTIVE: This work aims to dissect the direct effect of body mass index (BMI)
    and its indirect effect through C-reactive protein (CRP) on leukocyte telomere
    length (LTL) to determine the mediation effect of CRP on the BMI-LTL association.
    METHODS: The study cohort included 5451 adults (1404 Mexican American, 3114 White,
    and 933 Black individuals; 53.5\% male; mean age = 49.2 years) from the 1999 to
    2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. General mediation models
    were used to examine the mediation effect of CRP on the BMI-LTL association. RESULTS:
    After adjusting for age, race, sex, physical activity, alcohol use, and serum
    cotinine, the total effect of BMI on LTL was significant (standardized regression
    coefficient, β = -.054, P {\textless} .001) without CRP included in the model.
    With inclusion of CRP in the model, the indirect effect of BMI on LTL through
    CRP was estimated at β equal to -.023 (P {\textless} .001), and the direct effect
    of BMI on LTL in its absolute value decreased to β equal to -.031 (P = .025).
    The mediation effect of CRP was estimated at 42.6\%. The mediation model parameters
    did not differ significantly between race and sex groups. CONCLUSION: These results
    suggest that the inverse BMI-LTL association is partly mediated by obesity-induced
    inflammation. The significant direct effect of BMI on LTL with removal of the
    mediation effect through CRP indicates that obesity is associated with LTL attrition
    also through other noninflammatory mechanisms.'

- abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Telomere length (TL) is related to age-related health outcomes,
    but little is known about the relationship between TL and complete blood count
    (CBC) parameters. We aimed to determine the relationship between TL and CBC in
    a sample of healthy US adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants in the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) recruited between 1999 and 2002
    who had essential data on total CBC and TL were studied. We computed age- and
    race-adjusted mean values for total CBC using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
    All statistical analyses accounted for the survey design and sample weights by
    using SPSS Complex Samples v22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Of the 8892
    eligible participants, 47.8\% (n = 4123) were men. The mean age was 41.8 years
    overall, 41.0 years in men and 42.6 in women (p = 0.238). The sex-stratified ANCOVA
    showed no significant difference in the total CBC across TL quartiles (all p {\textgreater}
    0.05) in both sexes. In the adjusted model, there was a significant negative relationship
    with monocyte count (β = -0.051, 95\% CI: -0.422; -0.142), mean cell hemoglobin
    (β = -0.051, 95\% CI: -0.038; -0.011) and red cell distribution width (β = -0.031,
    95\% CI: -0.054; -0.003), while there was a significant positive relationship
    with basophil ratio (β = 0.046, 95\% CI: 0.049-0.171). CONCLUSIONS: These results
    support the possibility that telomere attrition may be a marker for reduced proliferative
    reserve in hematopoietic progenitor cells.'

- abstract: An important goal of environmental health research is to assess the risk
    posed by mixtures of environmental exposures. Two popular classes of models for
    mixtures analyses are response-surface methods and exposure-index methods. Response-surface
    methods estimate high-dimensional surfaces and are thus highly flexible but difficult
    to interpret. In contrast, exposure-index methods decompose coefficients from
    a linear model into an overall mixture effect and individual index weights; these
    models yield easily interpretable effect estimates and efficient inferences when
    model assumptions hold, but, like most parsimonious models, incur bias when these
    assumptions do not hold. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian multiple index model
    framework that combines the strengths of each, allowing for non-linear and non-additive
    relationships between exposure indices and a health outcome, while reducing the
    dimensionality of the exposure vector and estimating index weights with variable
    selection. This framework contains response-surface and exposure-index models
    as special cases, thereby unifying the two analysis strategies. This unification
    increases the range of models possible for analysing environmental mixtures and
    health, allowing one to select an appropriate analysis from a spectrum of models
    varying in flexibility and interpretability. In an analysis of the association
    between telomere length and 18 organic pollutants in the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES), the proposed approach fits the data as well as more
    complex response-surface methods and yields more interpretable results.

    length--a marker of cell aging--and mortality in a nationally representative sample
    of US adults ages 50-84 years. We also examined moderating effects of age, sex,
    race/ethnicity, and education. METHODS: Data were from the National Health and
    Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002 (n = 3,091). Cox proportional hazards
    regression was used to estimate the risk of all-cause and cause- specific mortality
    adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking, body mass index, and
    chronic conditions. RESULTS: Eight hundred and seventy deaths occurred over an
    average of 9.5 years of follow-up. In the full sample, a decrease of 1 kilobase
    pair in telomere length at baseline was marginally associated with a 10\% increased
    hazard of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.1, 95\% confidence interval
    [CI]: 0.9, 1.4) and a 30\% increased hazard of death due to diseases other than
    cardiovascular disease or cancer (HR: 1.3, 95\% CI: 0.9, 1.9). Among African-American
    but not white or Mexican-American respondents, a decrease of 1 kilobase pair in
    telomere length at baseline was associated with a two-fold increased hazard of
    cardiovascular mortality (HR: 2.0, 95\% CI: 1.3, 3.1). There was no association

    and diabetes have been inconsistent, and there are few data available investigating
    the associations of telomere length with diabetes duration and control. We evaluated
    the relationship of leukocyte telomere length with diabetes, and the relationship

    States. We analyzed data were from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    (NHANES, 1999-2002) with follow-up data through 31 December 2015. Based on MLT,
    participants were categorized into low, middle and high groups. Multivariate Cox
    proportional hazards regression, subgroup analysis and generalized additive model
    (GAM) were performed by using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals
    (CIs). A total of 7827 participants were included in analysis (48.18\% male).
    After 158.26 months of follow-up on average, there were 1876 (23.97\%), 87 (1.11\%)
    and 243 (3.10\%) onset of all-cause, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular mortality.
    After adjustment for potential confounders, using the low group as the reference,
    HRs for all-cause (0.87 and 0.86), cerebrovascular (0.75 and 0.75) and cardiovascular
    mortality (1.01 and 0.69) for the middle to high groups were not statistically
    significant (all P{\textgreater}0.05 for trend). MLT was non-linearly related
    to all-cause mortality but not to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular mortality.
    It was the first study to demonstrate the non-linear relationship between MLT
    and all-cause mortality.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Reproductive health disparities may be partly explained by
    the cumulative effects of chronic stress experienced by socially disadvantaged
    groups. Although, telomere length (TL) and allostatic load score have each been
    used as biological markers of stress, the relationship between these two measures
    is unknown. METHODS: We investigated the association between leucocyte TL and
    allostatic load score in 1503 non-pregnant women (20-44 years) participating in
    the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002. We constructed
    six different allostatic load scores using either quartile- or clinical-based
    cut-points for 14 biomarkers based on previously published methods. We estimated
    associations between TL and allostatic load scores and component biomarkers using
    linear regression, also assessing interactions by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: After
    adjustment for age, longer TL was associated with higher HDL cholesterol and lower
    C-reactive protein and creatinine clearance; TL was not associated with the other
    component biomarkers. Shorter TL was associated with higher allostatic load scores
    for the two clinical cut-point-based scores after adjustment for age, but not
    the four scores based on quartile cut-points. Significant interactions by race/ethnicity
    were observed for TL and HbA1c and triglycerides, but not for other component
    biomarkers or allostatic load scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although TL and allostatic
    load score are both considered measures of cumulative stress, most component biomarkers
    and scores using quartile-based cut-points were not associated with TL. In reproductive-aged
    women, allostatic load scores using clinical-based cut-points were more strongly
    associated with TL compared with quartile-based scores.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: There are few studies on the association between nutrient
    intake and telomere length, which may reflect cumulative oxidative stress and
    indicate biological ageing. In the present study, we evaluated longitudinal associations
    between the consumption of micronutrients, including antioxidant nutrients and
    B vitamins involved in one-carbon transfer pathways, and leukocyte telomere length
    (LTL). METHODS: The study included 1958 middle-aged and older Korean men and women
    (age range at baseline: 40-69 years) from a population-based cohort. We collected
    dietary information at baseline using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire
    (June 2001 to January 2003) and assessed the consumption of micronutrients, including
    vitamins A, B(1) , B(2) , B(3) , B(6) , B(9) (folate), C and E, as well as calcium,
    phosphorus, potassium, iron and zinc. We measured LTL using a real-time polymerase
    chain reaction at the 10-year follow-up examination (February 2011 to November
    2012). RESULTS: In the multiple regression model adjusted for potential confounders,
    LTL was positively associated with the consumption of vitamin C (P {\textless}
    0.05), folate (P = 0.05) and potassium (P = 0.05) in all participants. In the
    age-stratified analysis, the association between the consumption of vitamin C
    (P {\textless} 0.01), folate (P {\textless} 0.05) and potassium (P {\textless}
    0.05) with LTL was significant only among participants aged {\textless}50 years.
    CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the earlier consumption of vitamin C, folate
    and potassium, which are abundant in fruits and vegetables, can delay biological
    ageing in middle-aged and older adults.'

- abstract: 'Background: Telomere is regarded as the fundamental aspect of cellular
    aging and copper is recognized as one of the most essential trace elements. The
    role of dietary copper intake in telomere length maintenance is seldom examined.
    This study aims to investigate if telomere length is to be associated with daily
    dietary copper intake. Methods: We used epidemiological data from a large national
    population-based health and nutrition survey. Dietary intake was assessed during
    the 24-h period before the interview date when blood sample was collected. Telomere
    length was measured from blood leukocyte using PCR method. The relationship between
    telomere length and dietary copper intake was assessed using multivariable linear
    regression models. We also examined if obesity, measured by body mass index, could
    modify the observed association. Results: There are 7,324 participants had both
    leukocyte telomere length measured and dietary copper intake assessed, around
    48.0\% of them were men. Telomere length was longer in women than that in men
    (1.05 ± 0.26 vs. 1.00 ± 0.26 T/S ratio), while dietary copper intake was less
    in women than that in men (1.12 ± 0.80 vs. 1.51 ± 1.61 mg). After controlling
    for age, sex, ethnicity, physical activity, current smoking status, hypertension,
    cardiovascular diseases, and body mass index in the multivariable linear regression
    models, one unit increase of log-transformed dietary copper intake was significantly
    associated with longer telomere length (β = 0.02, 95\% confidence interval: 0.01,
    0.04). We did not find a significant sex difference for this association. Conclusions:
    Dietary copper intake was significantly associated telomere length.The role of
    copper in human health might be involved in biological aging process.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Telomere length (TL) is a posited pathway through which chronic
    stress results in biological dysregulation and subsequent adverse health outcomes.
    Food insecurity is associated with shorter TL. Social support, which is defined
    by the size and function of an individual''s social network, is associated with
    better health outcomes. The present study assesses whether social support modifies
    the relationship between food security and TL. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study design.
    Linear regression was used to assess the association between food insecurity and
    TL, stratified by social support level. A multiplicative interacted model was
    used to formally test modification. SETTING: Data come from the National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 waves. PARTICIPANTS:
    Adults aged 60 years and older who have measurements for TL. RESULTS: Our sample
    comprised 2674 participants, and 63·5 \% of the total sample had low social support,
    with 13·3 \% being food insecure. In fully adjusted models, food insecurity was
    negatively though modestly associated (P = 0·13) with TL. Associations between
    food insecurity and TL were significantly modified by social support (interaction
    P = 0·026), whereby food insecurity had a stronger effect among individuals with
    high social support (coefficient = -0·099 (95 \% CI: -0·161, -0·038)) compared
    to low social support (coefficient = -0·001, (95 \% CI: -0·033, 0·032)). CONCLUSION:
    Food insecurity is modestly associated with shorter TL. Contrary to our hypothesis,
    food insecurity had more deleterious effects on TL among participants with high
    social support than low social support. Results may indicate that the food insecure
    population is a higher needs population, and increased social support reflects
    these needs rather than providing protective effects.'

    and oxidative stress that predicts chronic disease risk. Nutritional factors are
    related to LTL in adulthood, but these associations are not well characterized
    in children. We examined whether micronutrient status biomarkers were associated
    with LTL in school-age children. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study
    of 330 boys and 393 girls aged 5-12 years from Bogotá, Colombia. We quantified
    blood concentrations of hemoglobin, ferritin, zinc, vitamin A, folate, and vitamin
    B-12; and measured LTL using qPCR in DNA extracted from buffy coat. We estimated
    mean differences in LTL by quartiles of micronutrient status biomarkers and categories
    of relevant sociodemographic and anthropometric covariates with the use of linear
    regression. RESULTS: In girls, plasma vitamin B-12 was positively associated with
    LTL (adjusted LTL difference between extreme vitamin B-12 quartiles = 0.11; P,
    trend = 0.02). LTL was also positively associated with birth order in girls (P,
    trend = 0.02). In boys, LTL was not related to the micronutrient status biomarkers
    but, unexpectedly, it was positively associated with birth weight (P = 0.02),
    height-for-age Z score (P, trend = 0.01), and serum C-reactive protein (P, trend
    = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: LTL is associated with vitamin B-12 status among girls.
    LTL is also associated with birth weight, height, and C-reactive protein in boys.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length is associated with diseases of
    aging, but there is limited knowledge of diet and lifestyle determinants. OBJECTIVE:
    The objective was to examine cross-sectionally the association between diet, body
    composition, and lifestyle factors on leukocyte telomere length in women. DESIGN:
    Leukocyte telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
    in 2284 female participants from the Nurses'' Health Study, who were selected
    as controls for an investigation of biological predictors of cancer. Diet, lifestyle,
    and anthropometric data were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: After multivariate
    adjustment, dietary fiber intake was positively associated with telomere length
    (z score), specifically cereal fiber, with an increase of 0.19 units between the
    lowest and highest quintiles (P = 0.007, P for trend = 0.03). Although total fat
    intake was not associated with telomere length, polyunsaturated fatty acid intake
    (-0.26 units, quintile 5 compared with quintile 1: P = 0.002, P for trend = 0.02),
    specifically linoleic acid intake, was inversely associated with telomere length
    after multivariate adjustment (-0.32 units; P = 0.001, P for trend = 0.05). Waist
    circumference was inversely associated with telomere length [0.15-unit difference
    in z score in a comparison of the highest ({\textgreater} or = 32 in, 81.28 cm)
    with the lowest ({\textless} or = 28 in, 71.12 cm) category (P = 0.01, P for trend
    = 0.02) in the multivariate model]. We found no association between telomere length
    and smoking, physical activity, or postmenopausal hormone use. CONCLUSION: Although
    the strength of the associations was modest in this population of middle- and
    older-age women, our results support the hypothesis that body composition and
    dietary factors are related to leukocyte telomere length, which is a potential
    biomarker of chronic disease risk.'

- abstract: Telomere length is an index of cellular aging. Healthy lifestyles are
    associated with reduced oxidative stress and longer telomeres, whereas unhealthy
    behaviors are related to shorter telomeres and greater biological aging. This
    investigation was designed to determine if strength training accounted for differences
    in telomere length in a random sample of 4814 US adults. Data from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were employed to answer the research
    questions using a cross-sectional design. Time spent strength training was calculated
    by multiplying days of strength training per week by minutes per session. Participation
    in other forms of physical activity was also calculated based on reported involvement
    in 47 other activities. Weighted multiple regression and partial correlation were
    used to calculate the mean differences in telomere length across levels of strength
    training, adjusting for differences in potential confounders. With the demographic
    covariates controlled, strength training and telomere length were linearly related
    (F = 14.7, p = 0.0006). Likewise, after adjusting for all the covariates, the
    linear association remained strong and significant (F = 14.7, p = 0.0006). In
    this national sample, 90 min per week of strength training was associated with
    3.9 years less biological aging, on average. Regular strength training was strongly
    related to longer telomeres and less biological aging in 4814 US adults.

- abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Mildly increased bilirubin concentration has a protective
    effect on oxidative stress-related diseases. However, it remains unknown whether
    elevated circulating bilirubin is associated with longer telomere length. The
    aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the association between total
    bilirubin concentration and telomere length. METHODS: We used the data from the
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. The multivariable
    linear regression model was used to examine the association between total bilirubin
    concentration and telomere length. The nonlinear relationship was analyzed using
    a generalized additive model with the smoothing plot. RESULTS: A total of 7818
    participants with a mean age of 49.20 ± 18.82 years were included. Compared with
    the lowest concentration of total bilirubin (Q1), the highest quartile of total
    bilirubin concentration was associated with longer telomere length in male (β
    = 0.04, 95 CI\%: 0.00, 0.07, P = 0.024) and female (β = 0.04, 95 CI\%: 0.02, 0.04,
    P = 0.002). Furthermore, an inverted U-shaped relationship between total bilirubin
    and telomere length was found. On the left of turning points (total bilirubin
    {\textless} 0.5 mg/dL), total bilirubin concentration was positively associated
    with telomere length (β = 0.23, 95 CI\%: 0.14, 0.32, P {\textless} 0.001). However,
    the association between total bilirubin concentration and telomere length was
    not significant (β = 0.01, 95\% CI: -0.01, 0.04, P = 0.346) above the turning
    point. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence based on a nationally representative
    survey demonstrating a positive and nonlinear association between total bilirubin
    concentration and telomere length. Future large-scale prospective studies are
    warranted to confirm our findings.'

- abstract: The associations between milk intake frequency and milk fat consumption
    and telomere length, an index of biological aging, were studied using an NHANES
    sample of 5,834 U.S. adults and a cross-sectional design. The milk consumption
    variables were assessed with the NHANES Diet Behavior and Nutrition questionnaire.
    The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to measure leukocyte
    telomere length. Results showed that milk consumption frequency was not related
    to telomere length; however, there was a strong association between milk fat intake
    and telomere length. With the sample delimited to milk drinkers only, milk fat
    intake was linearly and inversely related to telomere length, after adjusting
    for the covariates (F = 8.6, P = 0.0066). For each 1 percentage point increase
    in milk fat consumed (e.g., 1\% to 2\%), adults had more than 4 years of additional
    biological aging. With milk fat intake divided into 5 categories (i.e., milk abstainers,
    nonfat, 1\%, 2\%, and full-fat milk), mean telomere lengths differed across the
    categories (F = 4.1, P = 0.0093). The mean telomere difference between the extremes
    of milk fat intake (nonfat vs. full-fat) was 145 base pairs, representing years
    of additional biological aging for full-fat milk consumers. Effect modification
    testing indicated that the milk fat and cellular aging association may be partly
    due to saturated fat intake differences across the milk fat groups. When the sample
    was delimited to adults reporting only high total saturated fat intake (tertile
    3), the milk fat and telomere relationship was strong. However, when the sample
    was restricted to adults reporting only low saturated fat consumption (tertile
    1), there was no relationship between milk fat intake and telomere length. Overall,
    the findings highlight an association of increased biological aging in U.S. adults
    who consumed high-fat milk. The results support the latest Dietary Guidelines
    for Americans (2015-2020), which recommend consumption of low-fat milk, but not
    high-fat milk, as part of a healthy diet.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Age-related cognitive decline begins in middle age and persists
    with age. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) decreases with age and is enhanced by
    inflammation and oxidative stress. However, whether shorter LTL correlates with
    cognitive decline remains controversial. AIMS: We aimed to investigate the relationship
    between LTL and cognitive decline in the American elderly. METHODS: We used data
    from the 1999 to 2002 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
    We included participants aged 65-80 with available data on LTL and cognitive assessments.
    The cognitive function assessment used the digit symbol substitution test (DSST).
    We applied multivariate modeling to estimate the association between LTL and cognitive
    performance. Additionally, to ensure robust data analysis, we converted LTL into
    categorical variables through quartile and then calculated the P for trend. RESULTS:
    After adjusting for age, cardiovascular disease (CAD) score, gender, race, body
    mass index (BMI), and educational level, LTL showed a positive correlation with
    DSST score (odds ratio [OR] 3.47 [0.14, 6.79], P = 0.04). Additionally, to further
    quantify the LTL-DSST interaction, we found a similar trend when LTL was regarded
    as a categorical variable (quartile) (P for trend = 0.03). CONCLUSION: LTL was
    associated with cognitive capabilities among the elderly, implying that LTL might
    be a biomarker of cognitive aging.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Early-life intelligence has been shown to predict multiple
    causes of death in populations around the world. This finding suggests that intelligence
    might influence mortality through its effects on a general process of physiological
    deterioration (i.e., individual variation in "biological age"). We examined whether
    intelligence could predict measures of aging at midlife before the onset of most
    age-related disease. METHODS: We tested whether intelligence assessed in early
    childhood, middle childhood, and midlife predicted midlife biological age in members
    of the Dunedin Study, a population-representative birth cohort. RESULTS: Lower
    intelligence predicted more advanced biological age at midlife as captured by
    perceived facial age, a 10-biomarker algorithm based on data from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Framingham heart age (r
    = 0.1-0.2). Correlations between intelligence and telomere length were less consistent.
    The associations between intelligence and biological age were not explained by
    differences in childhood health or parental socioeconomic status, and intelligence
    remained a significant predictor of biological age even when intelligence was
    assessed before Study members began their formal schooling. DISCUSSION: These
    results suggest that accelerated aging may serve as one of the factors linking
    low early-life intelligence to increased rates of morbidity and mortality.'

- abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to examine the association between leukocyte
    telomere length (LTL) and mortality (outcome variable), with consideration by
    physical activity behaviour. Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey were employed (N = 6,611; 20-85 yrs), with follow-up mortality
    assessment through 31 December 2006. DNA was extracted from whole blood to assess
    LTL via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared to those in the first
    LTL tertile, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for those in the
    2(nd) and 3(rd) LTL tertiles, respectively, was 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.60-1.12; P =
    .22) and 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.50-1.14; P = .18). However, after adjustments, LTL tertile
    3 (vs. 1) was associated with all-cause mortality (HR = 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.14-0.93;
    P = .03) for those who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise. Similarly, LTL
    was associated with CVD-specific mortality for those who engaged in moderate-intensity
    exercise (HR = 0.17; 95\% CI: 0.04-0.73; P = .02). Longer telomeres are associated
    with increased survival, particularly among men and those who are active, underscoring
    the importance of promotion of physical activity behaviour.'

- abstract: Telomere length is affected by lifestyle and environmental factors and
    varies between racial and ethnic groups; however, studies are limited, with mixed
    findings. This study examined the effects of tobacco use and smoke exposure on
    mean telomere length to identify critical age periods by race/ethnicity. We used
    time-varying effect modeling on the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey for continuous years 1999-2002 to observe the effects of active tobacco
    use and environmental tobacco smoke-measured through serum cotinine-and mean telomere
    length for adults 19 to 85 and older (N = 7826). Models were run for Mexican American,
    other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and other/multi-race categories
    to allow for time-varying group differences, and controlled for biological sex,
    socioeconomic status, education, and ever-smoker status. Serum cotinine was found
    to have an increasing effect on telomere length from age 37 to approximately age
    74 among Mexican Americans. Among other/multi-race individuals serum cotinine
    was found to have a decreasing effect at approximately age 42, and among Blacks,
    it had an overall decreasing effect from age 61 to 78. Findings reveal a further
    need to focus additional support and resources to intervene regarding disparate
    health effects from tobacco use and environmental smoke exposure for already vulnerable
    groups at particular ages.

- abstract: 'Telomere length has been hypothesized to be a marker of cumulative exposure
    to stress, and stress is an established cause of depression and anxiety disorders.
    The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between depression, anxiety
    and telomere length, and to assess whether this relationship is moderated by race/ethnicity,
    gender and/or antidepressant use. Data were from the 1999-2002 National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey. Telomere length was assessed using the quantitative
    PCR method of telomere length relative to standard reference DNA. Past-year major
    depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD), as
    well as depressed affect and anxious affect, were assessed using the Composite
    International Diagnostic Inventory (N=1290). Multiple linear regression was used
    to assess the relationship between depression and anxiety disorders and telomere
    length. Among women, those with GAD or PD had shorter telomeres than those with
    no anxious affect (β: -0.07, P{\textless}0.01), but there was no relationship
    among men (β: 0.08, P{\textgreater}0.05). Among respondents currently taking an
    antidepressant, those with MD had shorter telomeres than those without (β: -0.26,
    P{\textless}0.05), but there was no association between MD and telomere length
    among those not using antidepressants (β: -0.00, P{\textgreater}0.05). Neither
    depressive nor anxiety disorders were directly associated with telomere length
    in young adults. There was suggestive evidence that pharmacologically treated
    MD is associated with shorter telomere length, likely reflecting the more severe
    nature of MD that has come to clinical attention.'

- abstract: This investigation was designed to study the relationship between weight
    change over 10 years and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in a large sample of
    3070 randomly selected U.S. adults, 36-70 years old. The National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) data were used to examine the relationship between
    percent weight change and LTL. Potential mediating variables were controlled using
    partial correlation. After adjusting for age, race, year, and housing status,
    the association between percent weight change over 10 years and LTL was significant
    in women (F = 6.9, p = 0.0138). Adjusting for the demographic and several other
    covariates weakened the relationship slightly (F = 4.7, p = 0.0392). With all
    the covariates controlled, for each one percentage point increase in weight over
    the previous 10 years, telomeres were, on average, 3.48 base pairs (bp) shorter
    in women. Given that each one-year increase in age was associated with telomeres
    that were 15.0 bp shorter in women, the median weight change in U.S. women over
    the previous 10 years (an increase of 10.4\%) was predictive of LTLs that were
    36 bp shorter, on average, or an increase of 2.4 years of biological aging. Percent
    weight change over 10 years was not associated with LTL in U.S. men. Percent weight
    change over 10 years is a strong predictor of biological aging in U.S. women,
    but not in men.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a robust marker of biological
    aging, which is associated with obesity. Recently, the visceral adiposity index
    (VAI) has been proposed as an indicator of adipose distribution and function.
    OBJECTIVE: To evaluated the association between VAI and LTL in adult Americans.
    METHODS: There were 3193 participants in U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Surveys (1999-2002) included in this analysis. LTL was measured using quantitative
    PCR (qPCR) and expressed as telomere to single-gene copy ratio (T/S ratio). We
    performed multiple logistic regression models to explore the association between
    VAI and LTL by adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among all participants,
    VAI was associated with the shorter LTL (β: - 14.81, 95\% CI - 22.28 to - 7.34,
    p {\textless} 0.001). There were significant differences of LTL in VAI tertiles
    (p {\textless} 0.001). Participants in the higher VAI tertile had the shorter
    LTL (1.26 ≤ VAI {\textless} 2.46: β = - 130.16, 95\% CI [ - 183.44, - 76.87];
    VAI ≥ 2.46: β = - 216.12, 95\% CI [ - 216.12, - 81.42], p for trend: {\textless}
    0.001) comparing with the lower VAI tertile. We also found a non-linear relationship
    between VAI and LTL. VAI was negatively correlated with LTL when VAI was less
    than 2.84. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that VAI is independently
    associated with telomere length. A higher VAI is associated with shorter LTL.
    The results suggest that VAI may provide prediction for LTL and account for accelerating
    the biological aging.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that telomere length has significantly
    relationship with different age-related diseases. However, the relationship between
    mean telomere length (MTL) and elevated blood pressure (BP) has been unclear.
    Therefore, the aim of the recent study was tried to explore the association of
    MLT with BP. METHODS: There were 5,981 subjects from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Surveys (NHANES, 1999-2002) was included in analysis. The MTL was
    measured using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and expressed
    in telomere-to-single copy gene (T/S) ratio and grouped into quartiles. Multivariate
    linear [expressed in beta and 95\% confidence interval (CI)], logistic regression
    [odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CI] analyses and smooth curve fitting were performed
    to evaluate the relationship between MTL, BPs and the likelihood of hypertension.
    RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 45.2±17.3 years, including 2,923
    (48.9\%) males. After adjusting for potential confounders, MLT was significantly
    related to the prevalence of hypertension (OR: 0.12, 95\% CI: 0.02, 0.94; P=0.04).
    Smooth curve fitting found a non-linear relationship between MTL, the levels of
    systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and the prevalence of hypertension.
    The inflection points for the smooth curve of MLT were at 0.86, 1.02 and 0.80
    (T/S ratio) respectively. The betas (95\% CIs) for SBP [-12.58 (-20.07, -5.09),

- abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Short leukocyte telomere length (LTL) has become a hallmark
    characteristic of aging. Some, but not all, evidence suggests that physical activity
    (PA) may play an important role in attenuating age-related diseases and may provide
    a protective effect for telomeres. The purpose of this study was to examine the
    association between PA and LTL in a national sample of US adults from the National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. METHODS: National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey data from 1999 to 2002 (n = 6503; 20-84 yr) were used. Four
    self-report questions related to movement-based behaviors (MBB) were assessed.
    The four MBB included whether individuals participated in moderate-intensity PA,
    vigorous-intensity PA, walking/cycling for transportation, and muscle-strengthening
    activities. An MBB index variable was created by summing the number of MBB an
    individual engaged in (range, 0-4). RESULTS: A clear dose-response relation was
    observed between MBB and LTL; across the LTL tertiles, respectively, the mean
    numbers of MBB were 1.18, 1.44, and 1.54 (Ptrend {\textless} 0.001). After adjustments
    (including age) and compared with those engaging in 0 MBB, those engaging in 1,
    2, 3, and 4 MBB, respectively, had a 3\% (P = 0.84), 24\% (P = 0.02), 29\% (P
    = 0.04), and 52\% (P = 0.004) reduced odds of being in the lowest (vs highest)
    tertile of LTL; MBB was not associated with being in the middle (vs highest) tertile
    of LTL. CONCLUSIONS: Greater engagement in MBB was associated with reduced odds
    of being in the lowest LTL tertile.'

- abstract: 'Telomeres contain TTAGGG (T; Thymine, A; Adenine and G; Guanine) repetitive
    sequences and are placed at the end of human chromosomes. Telomere dysfunction
    is implicated in some age-related and chronic diseases, but its association with
    total serum lipids and obesity is unknown. Our objective was to determine influenced
    of total serum lipids on leukocyte telomere lengths (TLs). Participants were selected
    by cluster sampling from 22 districts of Tehran. The questionnaires were completed
    by 500 subjects and after the initial assessment in terms of lifestyle, nutrition,
    home, and job, 300 healthy people, aged 25-40 years were finally selected. TLs
    and serum level of total lipids were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and
    the Phillips method, respectively. The average telomere length (T/S) and total
    lipids were 1.05 ± 0.3 mg/dl and 643.3 ± 70.8 mg/dl, respectively. We found that
    a one unit difference in the following parameters were associated with kilo base
    pair differences in TL: Age -0.0002 (95\% CI [-0.0022, -0.0018]), BMI -0.0019
    (95\% CI [-0.0003, -0.0034]), TC 0.0001 (95\% CI [-0.0006, -0.0007]), TG -0.0010
    (95\% CI [-0.0015, -0.0004]), PL 0.0001 (95\% CI [-0.0005, -0.0007]), and TSL
    -0.0003 (95\% CI [-0.0008, 0.0001]). Spearman correlation analysis revealed an
    inverse relationship between TC (R = -0.53; 95\% CI [-0.61, -0.44]), TG (R = -0.50;
    95\% CI [-0.58, -0.41]), PL (R = -0.46; 95\% CI [-0.54-0.36]), and TSL (R = -0.63;
    95\% CI [-0.69, -0.56]) with T/S. Our research suggests that the inverse relationship
    was found between TL and weight, BMI, age, and TSL which were associated with
    obesity. High serum lipids concentration may be associated with systemic inflammation
    and atherosclerosis and may lead to oxidative stress, resulting in telomere shortening.'

- abstract: Exposure to some environmental chemicals is reportedly associated with
    the leucocyte telomere length (LTL), but the effects of the non-occupational exposure
    to polyfluoroalkyl chemical (PFCs) on the LTL are not well understood. Using data
    from 773 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    (NHANES) conducted in 1999-2000, we analysed the association between blood PFC
    concentrations and LTL. Coefficients (betas) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs)
    for the blood PFC concentrations in association with the LTL were estimated using
    multivariate linear regression models after adjustment for age, gender, race,
    body mass index (BMI), poverty income ratio, educational level, white blood cell
    count, C-reactive protein and other PFCs. The results identified a strong positive
    association between the blood perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) concentration
    and LTL in adults, and no associations were found between the LTL and other PFCs.
    In the linear regression models, each increment of one standard deviation (SD)
    in the base-10-logarithm-transformed PFOS concentration was associated with a
    21-bp increase in the LTL in the fully adjusted model (P = 0.033). Moreover, serum
    PFOS was associated with the LTL mainly in females and individuals aged 40-50,
    as demonstrated by stratified analyses. These results provide epidemiological
    evidence showing that environment-related levels of serum PFOS are positively
    associated with the LTL in adults.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated
    with several chronic diseases, but only a few studies have assessed the association
    between dietary factors and LTL. Our objective was to study the association between
    fats, fruits, vegetables and LTL in a cross-sectional study design. We hypothesized
    that intakes of fruits and vegetables would be positively associated with LTL
    and that intakes of fats, and especially saturated fatty acids (SFAs), would be
    negatively associated with LTL. SUBJECTS/METHODS: LTL was measured by quantitative
    real-time polymerase chain reaction in 1942 men and women aged 57-70 years from
    the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. We assessed the whole diet by a validated semiquantitative
    128-item food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: In general, there were only a
    few significant results. However, total fat and SFA intake (P=0.04 and 0.01, respectively)
    were inversely associated with LTL in men adjusting for age and energy intake.
    In women, vegetable intake was positively associated with LTL (P=0.05). Men consuming
    the most butter and least fruits had significantly shorter telomeres than those
    consuming the lowest amounts of butter and highest amounts of fruits (P=0.05).
    We found no association between LTL and body mass index, waist-hip ratio, smoking,
    physical activity or educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional
    study of elderly men and women, there were only a few statistically significant
    effects of diet, but in general they support the hypothesis that fat and vegetable
    intakes were associated with LTL.'

- abstract: Despite racial disparities in diseases of aging and premature mortality,
    non-Hispanic Black Americans tend to have longer leukocyte telomere length (LTL),
    a biomarker of cellular aging, than non-Hispanic White Americans. Previous findings
    suggest that exposure to certain persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is both
    racially-patterned and associated with longer LTL. We examine whether Black/White
    differences in LTL are explained by differences in exposure to 15 POPs by estimating
    the indirect effect (IE) of self-reported race on LTL that is mediated through
    nine polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), three furans, and three dioxins, as well
    as their mixtures. Our study population includes 1,251 adults from the 1999-2000
    and 2001-2002 cycles of the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey. We characterized single-pollutant mediation effects by constructing survey-weighted
    linear regression models. We also implemented various approaches to quantify a
    global mediation effect of all POPs, including unpenalized linear regression,
    ridge regression, and examination of three summary exposure scores. We found support
    for the hypothesis that exposure to PCBs partially mediates Black/White differences
    in LTL. In single-pollutant models, there were significant IEs of race on LTL
    through six individual PCBs (118, 138, 153, 170, 180, and 187). Ridge regression
    (0.013, CI 0.001, 0.023; 26.0\% mediated) and models examining summative exposure
    scores with linear combinations derived from principal components analysis (0.019,
    CI 0.009, 0.029; 34.8\% mediated) and Toxic Equivalency Quotient (TEQ) scores
    (0.016, CI 0.005, 0.026; 28.8\% mediated) showed significant IEs when incorporating
    survey weights. Exposures to individual POPs and their mixtures, which may arise
    from residential and occupational segregation, may help explain why Black Americans
    have longer LTL than their White counterparts, providing an environmental explanation
    for counterintuitive race differences in cellular aging.

- abstract: 'In Lebanon, data stemming from national cross-sectional surveys indicated
    significant increasing trends in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and
    associated behavioral and age-related risk factors. To our knowledge, no data
    are available on relative telomere length (RTL) as a potential biomarker for age-related
    diseases in a Lebanese population. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether
    there is an association between RTL and demographic characteristics, lifestyle
    habits and diseases in the Lebanese. This was a cross-sectional study of 497 Lebanese
    subjects. Peripheral blood RTL was measured by amplifying telomere and single
    copy gene using real-time PCR. Mean ± SD RTL was 1.42 ± 0.83, and it was categorized
    into 3 tertiles. Older age (P=0.002) and wider waist circumference (WC) (P=0.001)
    were statistically significantly associated with shorter RTL. Multinomial logistic
    regression showed that subjects who had some level of sleeping difficulty had
    a statistically significantly shorter RTL when compared to those with no sleeping
    difficulties at all [OR (95\% CI): 2.01 (1.11-3.62) in the first RTL tertile].
    Importantly, statistically significantly shorter RTL was found with every additional
    10 cm of WC [OR (95\% CI): 1.30 (1.11-1.52) for first RTL tertile]. In addition,
    and after performing the multivariate logistic regression and adjusting for "predictors"
    of RTL, the odds of having hypertension or being treated for hypertension were
    higher in patients who had shorter RTL: OR (95\% CI): 2.45 (1.36-4.44) and 2.28
    (1.22-4.26) in the first RTL tertiles respectively with a similar trend, though
    not statistically significant, in the second RTL tertiles. This is the first study
    in Lebanon to show an association between age, central obesity, poor sleep and
    hypertension and RTL. It is hoped that telomere length measurement be potentially
    used as a biomarker for biological age and age-related diseases and progression
    in the Lebanese.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if maternal
    age at birth of last child is associated with leukocyte telomere length in a nationally
    representative population of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. METHODS:
    We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,232 women from the National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey to examine maternal age at last birth and telomere
    length, surveyed between 1999 and 2002. We included perimenopausal and postmenopausal
    women age 40 years and older. Maternal age at last live birth was self-reported,
    and leukocyte telomere length was measured using quantitative polymerase chain
    reaction. We calculated least-squares geometric mean telomere length across categories
    of maternal age adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, number of live births, survey
    cycle, and history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy. P trend {\textless} 0.05 was
    considered statistically significant. For hypothesis-generation, we explored modification
    by reproductive and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: Maternal age at last birth
    was positively associated with telomere length: the multivariable-adjusted least-squares
    geometric mean leukocyte telomere length across categories of age at last birth
    ({\textless}25, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, ≥40 y) was 0.90, 0.93, 0.93, 0.95, and 0.96,
    respectively (P trend = 0.04). There was suggestive evidence this association
    may be restricted to those women with one or two live births or women who reported
    ever using oral contraceptives (P interaction {\textless}0.10 for both). CONCLUSIONS:
    Later maternal age was associated with longer telomere length in a nationally
    representative population of women. These data provide new insight into the biological
    relationship between reproductive history and long-term health. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A662.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: To verify whether shorter telomere length is associated with
    anorexia of ageing in community-dwelling older people. METHODS: Conducted as a
    cross-sectional investigation, the study enrolled 448 participants residing in
    an urban area of a municipality in Brazil. Relative telomere length in blood samples
    was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), whereas the
    presence of anorexia of ageing was determined using the Simplified Appetite Nutritional
    Questionnaire. Data analysis employed multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Among
    the 448 older individuals surveyed, 70.69\% were female, and the predominant age
    bracket ranged from 60 to 69 years (45.08\%). Approximately 25\% exhibited the
    shortest telomeric length, with a corresponding anorexia of ageing prevalence
    of 41.16\%. Older individuals with diminished telomere lengths displayed an increased
    likelihood of experiencing anorexia of ageing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.92; 95\% confidence
    interval [CI] = 1.12-3.29), independent of factors such as gender, age group,
    depressive symptoms, pain and performance in basic daily life activities. CONCLUSIONS:
    The observed association between anorexia of ageing and a telomeric biomarker

- abstract: Telomere integrity is influenced by oxidative stress. Also, inflammation-related
    factors, including nutritional factors, could modulate telomere integrity. The
    relationship between a posteriori-derived dietary patterns and telomere length
    (TL) has been scarcely investigated. Thus, our objective was to examine the association
    between empirically derived dietary patterns ascertained through principal component
    analysis (PCA) and TL in an older adult Spanish population. A total of 886 older
    adults ({\textgreater}55 years old; 645 males and 241 females) from the Seguimiento
    Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort were included in the study. TL was measured
    by monochrome multiplex real-time quantitative PCR. Age-adjusted TL was used for
    all analyses. Dietary patterns were identified by PCA based on thirty predefined
    candidate food groups collected from a validated 136-food items frequency questionnaire.
    Generalised linear models were fitted to obtain β-coefficients and their 95 \%
    CI evaluating differences in TL between each of the four upper quintiles of adherence
    to dietary patterns and the lowest quintile. Sensitivity analyses by rerunning
    all multiple linear models under different stratifications were performed to evaluate
    the robustness of our results. Two major dietary patterns were empirically identified,
    Western dietary pattern (WDP) and Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP). After adjustment
    for potential confounders, longer TL was found among subjects in the highest quintile
    of MDP (β = 0·064; 95 \% CI 0·004, 0·123). The WDP showed no significant association
    with TL. In conclusion, higher adherence to a posteriori-derived MDP was independently
    associated with longer telomeres in an older adult Spanish population of the SUN
    project.

- abstract: Telomeres contain TTAGGG repetitive sequences and are located at the end
    of human chromosomes. Telomere dysfunction is associated with some age-related
    and chronic diseases, but its relationship with foods, dietary patterns, and occupational
    class in the young male population is not yet known. In this cross-sectional study,
    300 healthy men, residents of Tehran, aged 25-40 years were enrolled from January
    to December 2016. We employed a cross-sectional study of 300 healthy people, residents
    of Tehran, aged 25-40 years. A food frequency questionnaire was used to obtain
    food intakes of all participants and converted into actual food intake (g/day).
    The principal components analysis was used to determine dietary patterns and other
    demographic characteristics. Leukocyte telomere length (TL) was measured by quantitative
    real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure number of telomere repeat
    copy number (T) to the relative number of 36B4 copies (S) (T/S ratio). T/S in
    office-workers, waste recyclers, and other workers were 1.22 ± 0.4, 1.08 ± 0.3,
    and 1.094 ± 0.34, respectively. The results of multivariate linear regression
    adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking were showed that whole grains
    (β = 0.02; p = .05), refined grains, fruits and vegetables, fish and dairy products
    were associated with an increase in log-T/S, but consumption of nuts and seeds
    (β = -0.00072; p = .06), meats (β = -0.00043; p = .9), produced meats (β = -0.00238;
    p = .03), oils and solid fats (β = -0.00146; p = .03) had a negative relationship
    with log-T/S in all studied occupational classes. A positive relationship was
    reported between the healthy (β = 0.017; p = .2) and traditional dietary pattern
    (β = 0.012; p = .4) with log-T/S, but western pattern identified negative relationship
    (β = -0.004; p = .7). Adherence to a healthy (with consumption whole grains, refined
    grains, dairy, and cereals) and then traditional pattern with increased consumption

- abstract: Low creatine availability may be linked to an elevated risk of neuronal
    damage, yet this association remains inadequately explored at the population level.
    Utilizing 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, the
    current study found a negative correlation between dietary creatine intake and
    serum levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL; a biomarker for neuronal damage)
    in a cohort of 1912 individuals (52.2\% females) aged 20-75 years. This inverse
    association persisted even after adjusting for other nutritional variables known
    to influence neuronal viability. The observed pattern, where increased dietary
    creatine intake was associated with reduced circulating NfL levels, suggests potential
    protective effects of creatine against neuronal injury.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Excess iron levels can induce oxidative stress and could
    therefore affect telomere attrition. However, little is known about the impact
    of body iron status on telomere length. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the
    association between serum ferritin concentrations, an indicator of body iron status,
    and leukocyte telomere length in US adults. DESIGN: We conducted a nationwide,
    population-based, cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: We used data from
    the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. We included
    7,336 adults aged 20 years or older who had available data on serum ferritin levels
    and telomere length. High ferritin levels were defined as a serum ferritin level
    {\textgreater}200 ng/mL (449.4 pmol/L) in women and {\textgreater}300 ng/mL (674.1
    pmol/L) in men. Low ferritin levels were defined as a serum ferritin level {\textless}30
    ng/mL (67.4 pmol/L). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Leukocyte telomere length was assayed
    using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. STATISTICAL ANALYSES:
    Linear regression with survey weights was performed to estimate the association
    between serum ferritin levels and telomere length. RESULTS: The prevalence of
    adults with high and low serum ferritin levels was 10.9\% and 17.6\%, respectively.
    High ferritin levels were inversely associated with telomere length compared to
    normal ferritin levels. After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle
    factors, body mass index, C-reactive protein, and leukocyte cell type composition,
    the β coefficient for log-transformed telomere length was -0.020 (standard error
    [SE]=0.009; P=0.047). The association was stronger in adults aged 65 years or
    older (β coefficient -0.081, SE=0.017; P{\textless}0.001) than in adults 20 to
    44 years old (β coefficient -0.023, SE=0.019; P=0.24) or adults aged 45 to 64
    years old (β coefficient 0.024, SE=0.015; P=0.10) (P for interaction 0.003). Low
    ferritin levels were not significantly associated with telomere length compared
    with normal ferritin levels. CONCLUSIONS: In a US nationally representative population,
    high body iron status was associated with shorter telomeres, especially in adults
    aged 65 years or older.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Dietary energy restriction in mammals, particularly at a
    young age, extends the life span. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is thought to
    be a bioindicator of aging in humans. High n-6 (omega-6) PUFA intake may accelerate
    LTL attrition. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether lower energy and higher PUFA intakes
    in young adulthood are associated with shorter LTL in cross-sectional and longitudinal
    analyses. DESIGN: In a longitudinal observational study (405 men, 204 women),
    diet was determined at baseline by a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire,
    and LTL was determined by Southern blots at mean ages of 30.1 y (baseline) and
    43.2 y (follow-up). Spearman correlations and multivariable linear regression
    were used. RESULTS: Baseline energy intake was inversely associated with follow-up
    LTL in men (standardized β = -0.171, P = 0.0005) but not in women (P = 0.039 for
    sex interaction). The difference in men between the highest and lowest quintiles
    of energy was 244 base pairs (bp) (95\% CI: 59, 429 bp) and between extreme quintiles
    of LTL was 440 kcal (95\% CI: 180, 700 kcal). Multivariable adjustment modestly
    attenuated the association (β = -0.157, P = 0.002). Inverse associations, which
    were noted for all macronutrients, were strongest for the unsaturated fatty acids.
    In multivariable models including energy and the macronutrients (as percentage
    of energy), the significant inverse energy-LTL association (but not the PUFA-LTL
    association) persisted. The energy-LTL association was restricted to never smokers
    (standardized β = -0.259, P = 0.0008; P = 0.050 for the smoking × calorie interaction).
    CONCLUSIONS: The inverse calorie intake-LTL association is consistent with trial
    data showing beneficial effects of calorie restriction on aging biomarkers. Further
    exploration of energy intake and LTL dynamics in the young is needed.'

    sample. SUBJECTS/METHODS: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
    database was used for this study. Gas chromatography was used to separate derivatised
    fatty acids (Four major TFAs [palmitelaidic acid (C16:1n-7t), trans vaccenic acid
    (C18:1n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1n-9t), and linoelaidic acid (C18:2n-6t,9t)]) which

    analyses used multivariable linear regressions, while accounting for the survey
    design. RESULTS: A total of 5446 eligible participants, with 46.8\% (n = 2550)
    being men, were included. Their average age was 47.1 years for the total sample,
    and 47.8 and 46.5 years in men and women respectively (p = 0.085 for men vs. women
    difference). Concentrations of palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid decreased
    with increasing length of the telomere (p {\textless} 0.05). Univariable linear
    regressions revealed a significant negative association between levels of the
    palmitelaidic acid, elaidic acid, vaccenic acid, and linolelaidic acid with TL.
    However when models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital
    status, sub-clinical inflammation, body mass index, and smoking, only palmitelaidic
    acid and linolelaidic acid remained significant (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:
    TFAs levels and particularly palmitelaidic and linolelaidic acids, are likely
    negatively associated with telomere lenght. Future studies should explore the
    potential implications of these associations.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Oxidative stress and inflammation seem to be potential
    underlying mechanisms for telomere attrition. A lack of specific antioxidants
    is believed to increase free radical damage and a greater risk for telomere shortening.
    Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between diet and leukocyte telomere length
    in a cross-sectional study of children and adolescents. We hypothesized that dietary
    total antioxidant capacity would be positively associated with telomere length.
    METHODS: Telomere length was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
    reaction in 287 participants (55\% males, 6-18 years), who were randomly selected
    from the GENOI study. RESULTS: A positive correlation between dietary total antioxidant
    capacity and telomere length (r = 0.157, p = 0.007) was found after adjustment
    for age and energy intake. However, higher white bread consumption was associated
    with shorter telomeres (β = -0.204, p = 0.002) in fully-adjusted models. Interestingly,
    those individuals who had simultaneously higher dietary total antioxidant capacity
    and lower white bread consumption significantly presented the longest telomeres.
    Moreover, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for very short telomeres was 0.30
    for dietary total antioxidant capacity (p = 0.023) and 1.37 for white bread (p
    = 0.025). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that longer telomeres were associated with
    higher dietary total antioxidant capacity and lower white bread consumption in
    Spanish children and adolescents. These findings might open a new line of investigation
    about the potential role of an antioxidant diet in maintaining telomere length.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Frailty and short telomere length, which address different
    aspects of biological aging, are separately associated with mortality in older
    adults. AIMS: To evaluate whether the combination of these two biomarkers would
    be a better predictor of mortality than either alone. METHODS: This present study
    included participants 60 years of age or older from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey in the 1999-2002 phase. The frailty phenotype was identified
    based on the Fried definition. Telomere length relative to standard reference
    DNA (T/S ratio) was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
    Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the individual
    and combined effects of frailty phenotype and telomere length on all-cause and
    cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Compared with participants with neither impairment,
    the mortality risks increased slightly among participants with short telomere
    length only (hazard ratio [HR] 1.19, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.42)
    or pre-frailty only (HR 2.16, 95\% CI 1.80-2.60) and gradually elevated approximately
    3 folds with both short telomere length and pre-frailty (HR 2.23, 95\% CI 1.81-2.74)
    or frailty (HR 3.57, 95\% CI 2.56-4.98). Moreover, participants with both short
    telomere length and frailty had the highest increased all-cause mortality (HR
    5.16, 95\% CI 3.38-7.85) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 4.67, 95\% CI 2.02-10.82).
    DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The combined predictor had more capability of predicting
    mortality, which suggested that integrating both molecular biomarkers and physiological
    functional parameters would be a more informative measure of biological aging.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Coffee is an important source of antioxidants, and consumption
    of this beverage is associated with many health conditions and a lower mortality
    risk. However, no study, to our knowledge, has examined whether varying coffee
    or caffeine consumption levels are associated with telomere length, a biomarker
    of aging whose shortening can be accelerated by oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: We
    performed a large comprehensive study on how coffee consumption is associated
    with telomere length. METHODS: We used data from the Nurses'' Health Study (NHS),
    a prospective cohort study of female nurses that began in 1976. We examined the
    cross-sectional association between coffee consumption and telomere length in
    4780 women from the NHS. Coffee consumption information was obtained from validated
    food-frequency questionnaires, and relative telomere length was measured in peripheral
    blood leukocytes by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Unconditional
    logistic regression was used to obtain ORs when the telomere length outcome was
    dichotomized at the median. Linear regression was used for tests of trend with
    coffee consumption and telomere length as continuous variables. RESULTS: Higher
    total coffee consumption was significantly associated with longer telomeres after
    potential confounding adjustment. Compared with non-coffee drinkers, multivariable
    ORs for those drinking 2 to {\textless}3 and ≥3 cups of coffee/d were, respectively,
    1.29 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.68) and 1.36 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.78) (P-trend = 0.02). We
    found a significant linear association between caffeine consumption from all dietary
    sources and telomere length (P-trend = 0.02) after adjusting for potential confounders,
    but not after additionally adjusting for total coffee consumption (P-trend = 0.37).
    CONCLUSIONS: We found that higher coffee consumption is associated with longer
    telomeres among female nurses. Future studies are needed to better understand
    the influence of coffee consumption on telomeres, which may uncover new knowledge
    of how coffee consumption affects health and longevity.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes (BTEXs) are a
    group of aromatic air pollutants from fossil fuels. There is no research on associations
    of the BTEXs mixture with telomere length (TL), a marker of cellular aging, in
    the general population. METHODS: We analyzed a subsample of 549 US adults aged
    20-59 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000.
    BTEXs samples were collected by passive exposure badges worn by participants for
    48-72 h. Levels of BTEXs were measured with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
    Leukocyte TL was measured with qPCR. We used Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression
    (BKMR) to examine the effect of the BTEXs mixture on TL adjusting for potential
    confounders. Analyses were stratified by tobacco smoking status (serum cotinine≥10
    ng/mL vs. {\textless}10 ng/mL). RESULTS: Levels of personal exposure to BTEXs
    were detectable in most participants and were relatively higher in the 150 smokers
    than in the 399 nonsmokers. The BTEXs were moderately or strongly intercorrelated
    (0.5 {\textless} r ≤ 0.9, P {\textless} 0.05). All chemicals had weak, inverse
    correlations with TL (-0.1{\textless}r {\textless} 0, P {\textgreater} 0.05).
    In BKMR models among the nonsmokers, the BTEXs mixture was significantly inversely
    associated with TL at a low range of the BTEXs (20th-65th percentile) but was
    not associated with TL at a higher range ({\textgreater}65th percentile). Also,
    we found a U-shape association of benzene and a positive association of ethylbenzene
    with TL independent of other BTEXs. Among smokers, neither the BTEXs mixture nor
    any individual BTEXs were significantly associated with TL. CONCLUSION: Within
    a low-to-middle range, exposure to the BTEXs mixture may be associated with shorter
    telomere length in the general nonsmoking population.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Previous research demonstrates that physical activity participation
    is associated with longer leukocyte telomere length, with shorter leukocyte telomere
    length being a hallmark characteristic of cellular aging. What remains under-investigated,
    however, is whether there is a mode-specific association of physical activity
    on leukocyte telomere length, which was this study''s purpose. METHODS: Data from
    the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used (N=6474
    adults analyzed). Leukocyte telomere length was assessed using quantitative polymerase
    chain reaction. Physical activity was assessed via self-report, with participants
    classified as meeting physical activity guidelines (≥2000 metabolic equivalent
    of task-min-month) for 9 separate physical activities, including aerobics (unweighted
    percent meeting guidelines: 2.98\%; n=193), basketball (2.0\%; n=129), bicycling
    (3.71\%; n=240), dance (2.30\%; n=149), running (3.09\%; n=200), stair climbing
    (1.33\%, n=86), swimming (1.85\%, n=120), walking (13.53\%; n=876), and weight
    lifting (2.61\%; n=169). RESULTS: In a single multivariable linear regression
    model including the independent variables of age, gender, race-ethnicity, weight
    status, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein, total metabolic equivalent of task-min-month
    of physical activity and the 9 binary meeting physical activity guideline variables,
    the only mode of physical activity that was significantly associated with leukocyte
    telomere length was meeting physical activity guidelines from running (β=0.06;
    95\% CI: 0.01-0.11; P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Running-specific physical activity was
    the only evaluated physical activity associated with leukocyte telomere length,
    which may provide one potential mechanism (i.e., leukocyte telomere length) through
    which running-based physical activity may help to prevent cardiovascular disease
    and premature mortality.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Dietary factors can affect telomere length (TL), a biomarker
    of aging, through oxidation and inflammation-related mechanisms. A Dietary Inflammatory
    Index (DII) could help to understand the effect of the inflammatory potential
    of the diet on telomere shortening. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the
    association of the DII with TL and to examine whether diet-associated inflammation
    could modify the telomere attrition rate after a 5-y follow-up of a Mediterranean
    dietary intervention. DESIGN: This was a prospective study of 520 participants
    at high cardiovascular disease risk (mean ± SD age: 67.0 ± 6.0 y, 45\% males)
    from the PREDIMED-NAVARRA (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea-NAVARRA) trial. Leukocyte
    TL was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction at baseline
    and after 5 y of follow-up. The DII was calculated from self-reported data by
    using a validated 137-item food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Longer telomeres
    at baseline were found in participants who had a more anti-inflammatory diet (lowest
    DII score) (P-trend = 0.012). Longitudinal analyses further showed that a greater
    anti-inflammatory potential of the diet (i.e., a decrease in the DII) could significantly
    slow down the rate of telomere shortening. Moreover, the multivariable-adjusted
    OR for short telomeres (z score ≤20th percentile) was 1.80 (95\% CI: 1.03, 3.17)
    in a comparison between the highest (proinflammatory) and the lowest (anti-inflammatory)
    DII tertiles. Similarly, a greater DII (greatest proinflammatory values) after
    a 5-y follow-up was associated with almost a 2-fold higher risk of accelerated
    telomere attrition compared with the highest decrease in DII (greatest anti-inflammatory
    values) during this period (P-trend = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed both
    cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the inflammatory potential
    of the diet and telomere shortening in subjects with a high cardiovascular disease
    risk. Our findings are consistent with, but do not show, a beneficial effect of
    adherence to an anti-inflammatory diet on aging and health by slowing down telomere
    shortening. These results suggest that diet might play a key role as a determinant
    of TL through proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms. This trial was
    registered at controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN35739639.'

- abstract: A shorter telomere length is associated with several systemic disorders.
    Telomere length may be an informative biomarker for the maintenance of the overall
    health status and mortality. There are a limited number of empirical studies concerning
    the effect of anthropometric parameters on telomere length. The data are derived
    from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2002. The
    primary outcomes of this study were to examine the potential relationships between
    the anthropometric indices and the telomere length, while secondary outcomes of
    this study was to investigate the association between different anthropometric
    indices and mortality risk. A significant positive correlation was noted between
    the mean telomere length and the thigh circumference (TC) and calf circumference
    (CC) in all designed models. Participants in the highest TC and CC quartiles tended
    to have a longer telomere length and lowered the hazards for all-cause mortality
    to 43\% and 57\%, respectively. Notably, the anthropometric indices involving
    the CC with higher values seemed to be surrogate markers for the reduction of
    the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and malignancy-related mortality (all P
    {\textless} 0.05). The CCmay be a valuable tool to guide public health policy
    and a clinical prognostic indicator for the risk of mortality.

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: Short telomeres and B vitamin deficiencies have been proposed
    as risk factors for age-related diseases and mortality that interact through oxidative
    stress and inflammation. However, available data to support this concept are insufficient.
    We aimed to investigate the predictive role of B vitamins and homocysteine (HCY)
    for mortality in cardiovascular patients. We explored potential relationships
    between HCY, B vitamins, relative telomere length (RTL), and indices of inflammation.
    METHODS: Vitamin B6, HCY, interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitive-C-reactive protein
    (hs-CRP), and RTL were measured in participants of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular
    Health Study. Death events were recorded over a median follow-up of 9.9 years.
    RESULTS: All-cause mortality increased with higher concentrations of HCY and lower
    vitamin B6. Patients in the 4th quartile of HCY and vitamin B6 had hazard ratios
    (HR) for all-cause mortality of 2.77 (95\% CI 2.28-3.37) and 0.41(95\% CI 0.33-0.49),
    respectively, and for cardiovascular mortality of 2.78 (95\% CI 2.29-3.39) and
    0.40 (95\% CI 0.33-0.49), respectively, compared to those in the 1st quartile.
    Multiple adjustments for confounders did not change these results. HCY and vitamin
    B6 correlated with age-corrected RTL (r = - 0.086, p {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.04,
    p = 0.031, respectively), IL-6 (r = 0.148, p {\textless} 0.001; r = - 0.249, p
    {\textless} 0.001, respectively), and hs-CRP (r = 0.101, p {\textless} 0.001;
    r = - 0.320, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Subjects with the longest telomeres
    had a significantly higher concentration of vitamin B6, but lower concentrations
    of HCY, IL-6, and hs-CRP. Multiple regression analyses identified HCY as an independent
    negative predictor of age-corrected RTL. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, hyperhomocysteinemia
    and vitamin B6 deficiency are risk factors for death from any cause. Hyperhomocysteinemia
    and vitamin B6 deficiency correlate with increased mortality. This correlation
    might, at least partially, be explained by accelerated telomere shortening induced
    by oxidative stress and systemic inflammation in these circumstances.'

- abstract: 'The influence of smoking exposure on telomere length with a focus on
    the impact of race has rarely been discussed. We performed a cross sectional analysis
    into the associations of smoking indicators with leukocyte telomere length (LTL)
    by race among 5864 nationally representative sample of US adults (≥20 years).
    Data from 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was used
    for the analysis. Smoking indicators were assessed by interviews and serum cotinine
    levels. LTL was quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Multiple linear regressions
    were used to assess the association with adjustment for covariates, sample weights
    and design effects separately for Whites, Blacks and Mexican Americans. The intensity
    of smoking, measured by the average number of cigarettes consumed per day, was
    negatively associated with LTL among Whites (β: -3.87, 95\% CI: -5.98 to -1.21)
    and among Blacks (β: -15.46, 95\% CI: -29.79 to -2.12) participants. Compared
    with cotinine level {\textless} 0.05 ng/ml, cotinine level ≥3 ng/ml was associated
    with shorter LTL (β: -77.92, 95\% CI = -143.05 to -11.70) among Whites, but not
    among Blacks. We found increased number of cigarette consumption to be associated
    with shorter LTL in both Blacks and Whites, indicating that the impact of smoking
    on life-shortening diseases could partly be explained by telomere biology. Increased
    cotinine concentration however, was associated with shorter LTL only among Whites,
    not among Blacks. This differential relationship that we observed may have implications
    in interpreting cotinine as an objective biomarker of smoking exposure across
    races and warrant additional prospective investigation.'

    length (TL), which is considered as a marker of biological age associated with
    the risk of chronic disease. We hypothesized that dietary exposure to polychlorinated
    biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins could affect TL. Our aim was to evaluate the association
    of dietary exposure to PCBs and dioxins with TL. In this cross-sectional study
    of 886 subjects older than 55 y (mean age: 67.7; standard deviation (SD): 6.1;
    27\% women) from the "Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra" (SUN) project. TL was
    determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and dietary PCBs
    and dioxins exposure was collected using a validated 136-item Food Frequency Questionnaire.
    Multivariable linear regression models were used to control for potential confounding
    factors. Shorter TL was associated with dietary total PCBs (SD of T/S ratio/(ng/day)
    = -0.30 × 10(-7); 95\% CI, -0.55 × 10(-7) to -0.06 × 10(-7)), dioxin-like PCBs

    with dioxins was associated with shorter TL. Further longitudinal studies, preferably
    with POPs measured in biological samples, are needed to confirm this finding.'

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: Telomeres are nucleotide sequences, and their function is to
    maintain cell surveillance. Exaggeration of the attrition rate of leukocyte telomere
    length (LTL) may result in genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Celiac disease
    (CD), an autoimmune inflammation of small intestine, has increasing prevalence
    in the elderly and may lead to lymphomas and gastrointestinal malignancies. We
    used nationally-representative datasets from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate if CD autoimmunity in older adults
    (age≥50years) is associated with shorter LTL. RESULTS: Our study included 3939
    subjects, where 25 subjects (mean age 65years) were CD seropositive and 3914 (mean
    age 64years) were CD seronegative. CD seropositive subjects had shorter LTL than
    CD seronegative subjects (P{\textless}0.001). In the linear regression model,
    CD seropositivity was significantly associated with 0.25kb pairs decrease in LTL
    length (P{\textless}0.001), adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, serum ferritin
    and folate, and ratio of family income to poverty. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally-representative
    population of adults age≥50years, CD seropositivity is significantly associated
    with shorter LTL, independently of age, sex, race/ethnicity, serum ferritin and
    folate, and socioeconomic status. This supports the enhanced telomere attrition
    in of CD seropositive adults.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Repeated nucleotide sequences combined with proteins called
    telomeres cover chromosome ends and dictate cells lifespan. Many factors can modify
    telomere length, among them are: nutrition and smoking habits, physical activities
    and socioeconomic status measured by education level. The aim of the study was
    to determine the influence of above mentioned factors on peripheral blood mononuclear
    cells telomere length. METHODS: Study included 28 subjects (seven male and 21
    female, age 18-65 years.), smokers and non-smokers without any serious health
    problems in past and present. Following a basic medical examination, patients
    completed the food frequency questionnaire with 17 foods and beverages most common
    groups and gave blood for testing. PBMC telomere length were measured with qualitative
    real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) method and expressed as a T/S ratio.
    RESULTS: Among nine food types (cereal, fruits, vegetables, diary, red meat, poultry,
    fish, sweets and salty snacks) and eight beverages (juices, coffee, tea, mineral
    water, alcoholic- and sweetened carbonated beverages) only intake of red meat
    was related to T/S ratio. Individuals with increased consumption of red meat have
    had higher T/S ratio and the strongest significant differences were observed between
    consumer groups: "never" and "1-2 daily" (p = 0.02). Smoking habits, physical
    activity, LDL and HDL concentrations, and education level were not related to
    telomere length, directly or as a covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Unexpected correlation
    of telomere length with the frequency of consumption of red meat indicates the
    need for further in-depth research and may undermine some accepted concepts of
    adverse effects of this diet on the health status and life longevity.'

- abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between socioeconomic
    status (SES) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) - a marker of cell aging that
    has been linked to stressful life circumstances - in a nationally representative,
    socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample of US adults aged 20-84. Using
    data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999-2002,
    we found that respondents who completed less than a high school education had
    significantly shorter telomeres than those who graduated from college. Income
    was not associated with LTL. African-Americans had significantly longer telomeres
    than whites, but there were no significant racial/ethnic differences in the association
    between education and telomere length. Finally, we found that the association
    between education and LTL was partially mediated by smoking and body mass index
    but not by drinking or sedentary behavior.

- abstract: 'There is evidence to support the links between lead and cadmium exposure
    with hypertension and also with leukocyte telomere length (LTL). The objective
    of this study is to investigate the role that LTL may play in the relationship
    between lead and cadmium exposure and hypertension. This study consisted of 3718
    participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
    1999-2002. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between blood
    metals with hypertension, and the mediating model was used to evaluate the mediating
    effect of LTL. In the fully adjusted model, both blood lead and cadmium ln-transformed
    concentrations were significantly positively associated with hypertension risk,
    as were all quartiles of blood lead. Additionally, we observed positive linear
    dose-response relationships with hypertension by restricted cubic spline analysis
    (both p overall {\textless} 0.001, p non-linear = 0.3008 for lead and p non-linear
    = 0.7611 for cadmium). The ln-transformed blood lead and cadmium concentrations
    were associated with shorter LTL. LTL was inversely related to hypertension and
    the OR was 0.65 (95\% CI: 0.47 to 0.89). Furthermore, LTL had mediating effects
    on the associations of blood lead and cadmium with hypertension risk, and the
    mediation proportions were 2.25\% and 4.20\%, respectively. Our findings suggested
    that exposure to lead and cadmium raised the risk of hypertension, while LTL played
    as a mediating factor.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There are limited data on the association between
    dietary information and leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which is considered an
    indicator of biological aging. In this study, we aimed at determining the association
    between dietary patterns or consumption of specific foods and LTL in Korean adults.
    SUBJECT/METHODS: A total of 1958 middle-aged and older Korean adults from a population-based
    cohort were included in the study. Dietary data were collected from a semi-quantitative
    food frequency questionnaire at baseline (June 2001 to January 2003). LTL was
    assessed using real-time PCR during the 10-year follow-up period (February 2011
    to November 2012). RESULTS: We identified two major factors and generated factor
    scores using factor analysis. The first factor labeled ''prudent dietary pattern''
    was characterized by high intake of whole grains, seafood, legumes, vegetables
    and seaweed, whereas the second factor labeled ''Western dietary pattern'' was
    characterized by high intake of refined grain, red meat or processed meat and
    sweetened carbonated beverages. In a multiple linear regression model adjusted
    for age, sex, body mass index and other potential confounding variables, the prudent
    dietary pattern was positively associated with LTL. In the analysis of particular
    food items, higher consumption of legumes, nuts, seaweed, fruits and dairy products
    and lower consumption of red meat or processed meat and sweetened carbonated beverages
    were associated with longer LTL. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diet in
    the remote past, that is, 10 years earlier, may affect the degree of biological
    aging in middle-aged and older adults.'

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between statin drug use and peripheral
    blood leukocyte telomere length in a U.S. nationally representative sample of
    adults. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002, representative of the noninstitutionalized
    U.S. POPULATION: The analytic study population included 3496 men and women aged
    40-84 years without a history of cancer and who had information of telomere length
    and statin use. RESULTS: Compared with nonusers, statin users were more likely
    to be former smokers, older, white, male, and had more comorbidities. Statin users
    did not have longer telomeres than nonusers after age (coefficient -0.013, p =
    .30) and multivariable (0.0003, p = .98) adjustment. After multivariable adjustment,
    log-transformed telomere length nonstatistically significantly increased with
    increasing duration of use (0.003, p-trend = .11), which did not differ by number
    of comorbidities (p-interaction = 0.18). Compared with nonuse, more than 5 years
    of use had an odds ratio of telomere length above the 75th percentile of 1.62
    (95\% confidence interval 0.90-2.92; p-trend = .10). CONCLUSIONS: Although telomere
    length appeared to be longer with longer duration of use of a statin, this association
    was not statistically significant, and we could not rule out bias as the explanation.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a putative biological
    marker of immune system age, and there are demonstrated associations between LTL
    and cardiovascular disease. This may be due in part to the relationship of LTL
    with other biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease risk. However, the
    strength of associations between LTL and adiposity, metabolic, proinflammatory,
    and cardiovascular biomarkers has not been systematically evaluated in a United
    States nationally representative population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined
    associations between LTL and 17 cardiovascular biomarkers, including lipoproteins,
    blood sugar, circulatory pressure, proinflammatory markers, kidney function, and
    adiposity measures, in adults ages 20 to 84 from the cross-sectional US nationally
    representative 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
    (n = 7,252), statistically adjusting for immune cell type distributions. We also
    examine whether these associations differed systematically by age, race/ethnicity,
    gender, education, and income. We found that a one unit difference in the following
    biomarkers were associated with kilobase pair differences in LTL: BMI -0.00478
    (95\% CI -0.00749--0.00206), waist circumference -0.00211 (95\% CI -0.00325--0.000969),
    percentage of body fat -0.00516 (95\% CI -0.00761--0.0027), high density lipoprotein
    (HDL) cholesterol 0.00179 (95\% CI 0.000571-0.00301), triglycerides -0.000285
    (95\% CI -0.000555--0.0000158), pulse rate -0.00194 (95\% CI -0.00317--0.000705),
    C-reactive protein -0.0363 (95\% CI 0.0601--0.0124), cystatin C -0.0391 (95\%
    CI -0.0772--0.00107). When using clinical cut-points we additionally found associations
    between LTL and insulin resistance -0.0412 (95\% CI -0.0685--0.0139), systolic
    blood pressure 0.0455 (95\% CI 0.00137-0.0897), and diastolic blood pressure -0.0674
    (95\% CI -0.126--0.00889). These associations were 10\%-15\% greater without controlling
    for leukocyte cell types. There were very few differences in the associations
    by age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, or income. Our findings are relevant
    to the relationships between these cardiovascular biomarkers in the general population
    but not to cardiovascular disease as a clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: LTL is most
    strongly associated with adiposity, but is also associated with biomarkers across
    several physiological systems. LTL may thus be a predictor of cardiovascular disease
    through its association with multiple risk factors that are physiologically correlated
    with risk for development of cardiovascular disease. Our results are consistent
    with LTL being a biomarker of cardiovascular aging through established physiological
    mechanisms.'

- abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Higher vitamin D levels and longer telomere length (TL)
    have been associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases and all-cause
    mortality. However, direct relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)
    levels and TL are not well established. Vitamin D could influence TL through its
    anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to assess the relationship between
    vitamin D levels and TL in US adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants of the
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with data available
    on 25(OH)D and TL measures from 2001 to 2002 were included. 25(OH)D levels were
    measured by the DiaSorin Radioimmunoassay. We used multivariable-adjusted linear
    regression models, accounting for the survey design and sample weights. RESULTS:
    Of the 4347 eligible participants, 47.0\% (n = 2045) were men. The mean age was
    42.7 years overall, 49.2 years in men and 42.5 years in women (p = 0.060). After
    adjustment for age, race, marital status, education, and C-reactive protein, each
    1 ng/ml higher 25(OH)D level was associated with a 0.045 (95\% confidence interval
    (CI): 0.032 to 0.059) longer telomere-to-single copy gene (T/S) ratio. This was
    driven by a significant association in women (0.054 (0.043 to 0.064)) and in men
    (0.036 (0.020 to 0.052)). However, after we further adjusted for smoking, body
    mass index, and physical activity, no significant relation was found in the overall
    sample (β coefficient -0.026, 95\% CI: -3.16, 1.67), for men (-0.016 (-3.72, 2.64)),
    or for women (-0.052 (-6.85, 2.26)). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a possible
    positive association between 25(OH)D levels and telomere length. The implications
    of this association deserve further investigation.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the decline in telomere length
    (TL) with age and evaluate effect modification by gender, chronic stress, and
    comorbidity in a representative sample of the US population. METHODS: Cross-sectional
    data on 7826 adults with a TL measurement, were included from the National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey, years 1999-2002. The population rate of decline
    in TL across 10-year age categories was estimated using crude and adjusted regression.
    RESULTS: In an adjusted model, the population rate of decline in TL with age was
    consistent and linear for only three age categories: 20-29 (β = -0.0172, 95\%
    CI: -0.0342, -0.0002), 50-59 (β = -0.0182, 95\% CI: -0.0311, -0.0054) and 70-79
    (β = -0.0170, 95\% CI: -0.0329, -0.0011) years. The population rate of decline
    in TL with age was significantly greater for males and those with high allostatic
    load and a history of comorbidities. When the population rate of decline in TL
    was analyzed by gender in 10-year age bins, a fairly consistent yet statistically
    non-significant decline for males was observed; however, a trough in the rate
    was observed for females in the age categories 20-29 years (β = -0.0284, 95\%
    CI: -0.0464, -0.0103) and 50-59 years (β = -0.0211, 95\% CI: -0.0391, -0.0032).
    To further elucidate the gender difference observed in the primary analyses, secondary
    analyses were conducted with reproductive and hormonal status; a significant inverse
    association was found between TL and parity, menopause, and age at menopause.
    CONCLUSIONS: TL was shorter with increasing age and this decline was modified
    by gender, chronic stress and comorbidities; individuals with chronic morbidity
    and/or chronic stress and females in their twenties and fifties experienced greater
    decline. Female reproductive factors, i.e., parity and menopause, were associated
    with TL.'

- abstract: 'AIMS: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) accelerates atherosclerotic
    cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and accordingly is the most potent hereditary cause
    of premature coronary heart disease. The association between telomere length (TL),
    a biological index of ageing, and FH has not been hitherto investigated. We addressed
    this question using data from the US National Health and Education National Surveys
    (NHANES, 1999-2002). METHODS AND RESULTS: We included individuals, who had TL
    measurements (with quantitative polymerase chain reaction method) and a phenotypic
    diagnosis of FH based on the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria. Sample
    weights were applied for unequal probabilities of selection, non-response bias,
    and oversampling by complex sample analysis. The adult prevalence of FH in NHANES
    was 0.43\% [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.33-0.57]. The frequencies of
    probable FH (mean DLCN score: 6.2) and definite FH (mean DLCN score: 8.9) were
    0.42\% (95\% CI 0.32-0.48) and 0.03\% (95\% CI 0.02-0.06), respectively. Subjects
    with FH had a higher prevalence of non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes
    2 type, and obesity) and early atherosclerosis (2.9\% in overall population vs.
    42.2\% in FH). Overall, the mean TL in the non-FH population was 1.09 (95\% CI
    1.06-1.12) (T/S ratio) and 1.09 (95\% CI 1.03-1.12) [(T/S ratio) for total FH].
    Telomere length adjusted for age, sex, race, and body mass index was shorter in
    FH compared with healthy subjects (FH 0.89, 95\% CI 0.84-0.93 vs. healthy: 1.05,
    95\% CI 0.97-1.11 T/S ratio; P {\textless} 0.001). Subjects with longer TL (highest
    quartile) had 12\% less chance of having FH compared with those with TL in the
    lowest quartile (Q1, 95\% CI 0.78-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest
    an association between TL, an index of biological age, and the presence of FH,
    the most common inherited cause of premature ASCVD. Given our relatively low sample
    size, the findings need confirmation in larger studies.'

- abstract: 'Aging is the biggest risk factor for the development of chronic diseases.
    Telomere length may represent one important mechanism by which dietary intake
    influences risk of age-related diseases; however, it is unknown which diet pattern
    is most strongly related to telomere length. We compared the relationships between
    4 evidence-based diet quality indices and leukocyte telomere length in a nationally
    representative sample of healthy adults, and the extent to which these associations
    differed between men and women. Data on 4,758 adults aged 20-65 years with no
    prior diagnosis of major chronic disease were obtained from the 1999-2002 cycles
    of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Diet was assessed using
    one 24-hour dietary recall. After adjustment for sociodemographic and health characteristics,
    comparison of the top and bottom quintiles showed that higher Healthy Eating Index
    2010 scores (β = 0.065, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.018, 0.112; P-trend =
    0.007), Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores (β = 0.054, 95\% CI: 0.010,

    (β = 0.052, 95\% CI: 0.014, 0.090; P-trend = 0.007) were each associated with
    longer telomere length in women. These results may provide insight into the complex
    associations between optimal nutrition and longevity. Further investigation is
    needed to understand why associations were not observed in men.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We investigated the association of prostate-specific antigen
    (PSA) with leukocyte telomere length, which may be altered in preclinical prostate
    malignancies. METHODS: This study was based on the 2001-2002 U.S. National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A subsample of 1,127 men aged 40-85
    years without prior history of prostate cancer who provided informed consent and
    blood samples were selected. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) relative to standard
    DNA reference (T/S ratio) was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Survey-weighted
    multivariable linear regression was performed to examine T/S ratio across quintiles
    of total and free PSA and free-to-total PSA ratio (\%fPSA). A sensitivity analysis
    was performed by excluding men dying from prostate cancer during follow-up through
    to December 31, 2006. Stratification analyses were carried out to assess any effect
    modification by age group, race, body mass index (BMI), and levels of C-reactive
    protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation. RESULTS: Higher total PSA levels were
    associated to longer LTL, with approximately 8\% increase in log-transformed T/S
    ratio (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2-13\%) among men in the highest quintile
    of total PSA compared to the lowest in the fully adjusted model (P(trend) = 0.01).
    No significant association was found for free PSA or \%fPSA, although nonlinearity
    between all PSA measures and T/S ratio was indicated. Similar results were found
    after excluding men who died from prostate cancer during follow-up. We also found
    the associations between total PSA and T/S ratio to be strongest among non-Hispanic
    blacks, non-obese men (BMI {\textless}30 kg/m(2) ), and those with low CRP. However,
    a significant interaction was only found between total PSA and race/ethnicity
    (P(interaction) = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Total PSA levels were strongly associated
    to LTL, particularly among non-Hispanic blacks. Our findings support a potential
    link between PSA and specific mechanisms contributing to prostate cancer development.

- abstract: INTRODUCTION Shorter leukocyte telomere length (TL) is associated with
    several chronic diseases, but only a few studies have assessed the associations
    of dietary components and dietary patterns with TL in adults in the United States
    (US). OBJECTIVES This study was aimed to determine the relation of dietary components
    and dietary patterns with TL among adults in the US. PATIENTS AND METHODS National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants with data on dietary
    intake and TL measures from 1999 to 2001 were included. Daily intakes of 60 nutrients
    and bioactive compounds were calculated for each participant. Factor analysis,
    followed by a varimax rotation, was applied to derive the major nutrient patterns.
    All statistical analyses accounted for the survey design and sample weights. RESULTS
    Of the 10 568 eligible participants, 48.0\% (n = 5020) were men; the mean age
    was 44.1 years. Mean (adjusted for sex, age, and race) dietary intakes of carbohydrate,
    dietary fiber, total folate, vitamin B6, magnesium, iron, copper, polyunsaturated
    fatty acids 22:5, and vitamin C monotonically increased across TL quarters (P
    {\textless}0.05 for all), while total fat and caffeine decreased across TL quarters
    (P {\textless}0.05 for all). Three food patterns together explaining 56.8\% of
    the variance of the dietary nutrient consumption were identified. We found that
    the second food pattern, which was a representative of minerals and vitamins,
    monotonically increased across TL quarters and had a positive association with
    TL. CONCLUSIONS Higher mineral and vitamin consumption is associated with longer
    telomeres among adults in the US.

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To provide a potential biological, mechanistic link for the
    well-established association between primary care access and reduced mortality,
    this study sought to measure the impact of having a usual source of health care
    on leukocyte telomere length (LTL). DATA SOURCES: Our study population included
    3202 participants aged 50 to 84 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey 1999 to 2001. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional Study. LTLs between people
    with and without a usual source of care were compared using unadjusted and adjusted
    linear regression models. Fully adjusted models accounted for demographic characteristics,
    health conditions, and health behaviors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After controlling
    for individual factors, health conditions, and health behaviors, people who had
    a usual source of health care had significantly longer LTL (β = 89.8 base pairs,
    P-value = .005) compared with those without a usual source of care; corresponding
    to approximately 7 years of life. CONCLUSIONS: Having a usual source of health
    care is associated with longer LTL among older adults. This study provides a potential
    biologic link for the noted association between primary care access and reduced
    mortality that has been observed at the individual and population level.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortening is characteristic
    of aging and is associated with morbidity and mortality, independent of age. Research
    demonstrates that lower extremity muscular strength is associated with mobility,
    morbidity and mortality; however, no study, to our knowledge, had examined the
    association between lower extremity muscular strength and LTL, which was the purpose
    of this brief study. METHODS: Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES was used (N = 2410;
    50-85 years). Peak isokinetic knee extensor strength (IKES) was objectively measured
    with LTL assessed from a blood sample. RESULTS: After adjustments, for every 50
    N increase in IKES, participants had a 9\% reduced odds (P = .04) of being in
    the 1st (vs. 4th) LTL quartile. DISCUSSION: Lower extremity muscular strength
    is associated with LTL, suggesting a possible mechanism through which lower extremity
    muscular strength may be associated with morbidity and mortality.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Sarcopenia is common in patients with liver disease
    and both sarcopenia and short telomeres are associated with mortality, however
    their relationship in patients with liver disease remains unknown. METHODS: A
    cohort of 16,072 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    from 1999 to 2006 was analyzed. Liver disease was defined by aminotransferases
    and classified into etiology-based categories. Sarcopenia was defined by dual-energy
    x-ray absorptiometry. All analyses were conducted separately on each multiple
    imputation data set and combined via Rubin''s rules. P-values for group comparisons
    were calculated by testing logistic regression parameter estimates. Cox proportional
    hazards regression was used for mortality analysis with mortality data available
    until 2015. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was present in 9.5\% of patients with liver disease.
    Age, race, income, education, physical inactivity, and certain medical comorbidities
    were associated with sarcopenia. Patients with liver disease and sarcopenia had
    significantly shorter telomeres than patients with liver disease without sarcopenia
    when unadjusted for age. The interaction between telomere length and sarcopenia
    was significantly associated with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The implications
    of telomere length on all-cause mortality in patients with liver disease varied
    by age and sarcopenia status. Shorter telomeres appear to be more highly associated
    with increased mortality in older patients without sarcopenia.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Peripheral leucocyte telomere length has been suggested to
    be inversely associated with hypertension risk. Both telomere length and hypertension
    risk can be modified by certain dietary factors, such as fruit and vegetables.
    This study was to examine the potential effect of these dietary factors on the
    association between telomere length and hypertension risk. STUDY DESIGN: A community-based
    case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: 271 hypertensive patients and 455 normotensive
    controls aged 40-70 years and living in Yinzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. OUTCOME
    MEASURES: Peripheral leucocyte relative telomere length (RTL) was measured using
    quantitative real-time PCR. Dietary intake was assessed by a brief semiquantitative
    food frequency questionnaire. The association between RTL and hypertension risk
    was analysed using logistic regression, and the modulatory effect of dietary intake
    on RTL-related hypertension risk was analysed using likelihood ratio tests. RESULTS:
    Among controls, longer age-adjusted RTL was associated with higher vegetable intake
    (p=0.01). Individuals with longer age-adjusted RTL (based on median value) were
    30\% less likely to have hypertension (OR=0.70, 95\% CI 0.52 to 0.96; p=0.03).
    The observed RTL-hypertension relationship appeared to be modified by vegetable
    intake-longer RTL was significantly associated with lower hypertension risk only
    in those with greater vegetable consumption (OR=0.28, 95\% CI 0.14 to 0.57; p{\textless}0.001),
    but not in those with lower vegetable intake (P-interaction=0.008). CONCLUSIONS:
    Certain dietary factors might modify telomere-related hypertension risk.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: We tested whether leukocyte telomere length maintenance,
    which underlies healthy cellular aging, provides a link between sugar-sweetened
    beverage (SSB) consumption and the risk of cardiometabolic disease. METHODS: We
    examined cross-sectional associations between the consumption of SSBs, diet soda,
    and fruit juice and telomere length in a nationally representative sample of healthy
    adults. The study population included 5309 US adults, aged 20 to 65 years, with
    no history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, from the 1999 to 2002 National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Leukocyte telomere length was assayed
    from DNA specimens. Diet was assessed using 24-hour dietary recalls. Associations
    were examined using multivariate linear regression for the outcome of log-transformed
    telomere length. RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related
    characteristics, sugar-sweetened soda consumption was associated with shorter
    telomeres (b = -0.010; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = -0.020, -0.001; P = .04).
    Consumption of 100\% fruit juice was marginally associated with longer telomeres
    (b = 0.016; 95\% CI = -0.000, 0.033; P = .05). No significant associations were
    observed between consumption of diet sodas or noncarbonated SSBs and telomere
    length. CONCLUSIONS: Regular consumption of sugar-sweetened sodas might influence
    metabolic disease development through accelerated cell aging.'

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: Telomeres, DNA-protein structures that cap and protect chromosomes,
    are thought to shorten more rapidly when exposed to chronic inflammation and oxidative
    stress. Diet and nutritional status may be a source of inflammation and oxidative
    stress. However, relationships between telomere length (TL) and diet or adiposity
    have primarily been studied cross-sectionally among older, overweight/obese populations
    and yielded inconsistent results. Little is known about the relationship between
    diet or body composition and TL among younger, low- to normal-weight populations.
    It also remains unclear how cumulative exposure to a specific diet or body composition
    during the years of growth and development, when telomere attrition is most rapid,
    may be related to TL in adulthood. METHODS: In a sample of 1459 young adult Filipinos,
    we assessed the relationship between blood TL at ages 20.8-22.5 and measures of
    BMI z-score, waist circumference, and diet collected between the ages of 8.5 and
    22.5. TL was measured using monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR, and diet was
    measured using multiple 24-h recalls. RESULTS: We found no associations between
    blood TL and any of the measures of adiposity or between blood TL and the seven
    dietary factors examined: processed meats, fried/grilled meats and fish, non-fried
    fish, coconut oil, fruits and vegetables, bread and bread products, and sugar-sweetened
    beverages. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the inconsistencies in the literature and
    our null results, small differences in body composition and consumption of any
    single pro- or anti-inflammatory dietary component may not by themselves have
    a meaningful impact on telomere integrity, or the impact may differ across distinct
    ecological circumstances.'

- abstract: Socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have been associated with
    poor health outcomes. Little is known about the biological mechanism by which
    deprived neighborhood conditions exert negative influences on health. Data from
    the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were
    used to assess the relationship between neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) and
    log-transformed leukocyte telomere length (LTL) via multilevel modeling to control
    for census tract level clustering. Models were constructed using tertiles of NDI
    (ref = low NDI). NDI was calculated using census tract level socioeconomic indicators
    from the 2000 U.S. Census. The sample (n = 5,106 adults) was 49.8\% female and
    consisted of 82.9\% non-Hispanic whites, 9.4\% non-Hispanic blacks, and 7.6\%
    Mexican Americans. Mean age was 45.8 years. Residents of neighborhoods with high
    NDI were younger, non-white, had lower educational attainment, and had a lower
    poverty to income ratio (all p {\textless} 0.0001). Neighborhood deprivation was
    inversely associated with LTL among individuals living in neighborhoods with medium
    NDI (β = -0.043, SE = 0.012, p = 0.0005) and high NDI (β = -0.039, SE = 0.013,
    p = 0.003). Among men, both medium (β = -0.042, SE = 0.015, p = 0.006) and high
    (β = -0.047, SE = 0.015, p = 0.001) NDI were associated with shorter LTL. Among
    women, only medium NDI (β = -0.020, SE = 0.016, p = 0.009) was associated with
    shorter LTL. After controlling for individual characteristics, including individual-level
    socioeconomic status, increasing neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation is associated
    with shorter LTL among a nationally representative sample of US adults. This suggests
    that telomere shortening may be a mechanism through which neighborhood deprivation
    results in poor health outcomes.

- abstract: Obesity is associated with age-related health conditions and telomere
    attrition - a marker of cellular aging. Obesity is attributable to adverse modifiable
    lifestyle factors. Little is known about the mediation effect of lifestyle factors
    associated with the relationship between obesity and telomere length. Our objective
    was to examine this association in the US. Pack years smoked, drinking level per
    day, physical activity (PA) per week and diet based on Healthy Eating Index (HEI)
    were assessed as mediators associated with the relationship between adiposity
    measures and leukocyte telomere length (LTL); adiposity measures included body
    mass index (BMI), \% total body fat (TBF) and waist circumference (WC). Separate
    adjusted linear regressions and mediation analysis were conducted on a total of
    4919 respondents aged 20-84 years using cross-sectional 1999-2002 data from the
    US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Inadequate PA correlated
    with 1.28\% shorter LTL and was a factor accounting for 35\% of the relationship
    between BMI and LTL (β = -0.0128, 95\% CI = 0.0259, 0.0004, p = .05). Smoking
    30-≥59 pack years correlated with 4\% shorter LTL and accounted for 21\% of the
    relationship between \%TBF and LTL (β = -0.0386, 95\% CI = -0.0742, -0.0030, p
    = .03). Improvement in diet correlated with 0.11\% longer LTL and contributed
    25\% of the association between \%TBF and LTL (β = 0.0011, 95\%CI =0.0004, 0.0018,
    p = .01). Diet correlated with 0.11\% longer LTL and correspond to 28\% of the
    relationship between WC and LTL (β = 0.0011, 95\%CI = 0.0004, 0.0018, p = .03).
    Interventions to improve modifiable behaviors may ameliorate cellular aging and
    aging related health conditions due to obesity among US adults.

- abstract: 'Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to all-cause mortality
    and cancer. However, the biological plausibility of these associations is not
    well established. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortening is associated with
    aging and is a hallmark of genomic instability and carcinogenesis.Objective: We
    aimed to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
    concentrations and LTL in the general US population.Methods: We analyzed data
    from the US NHANES 2001-2002. The study population comprised 1542 younger adults
    (aged 20-39 y), 1336 middle-aged adults (aged 40-59 y), and 1382 older adults
    (aged ≥60 y). LTL was measured by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
    Serum 25(OH)D concentrations ≥50 nmol/L were considered optimal. Linear regression,
    adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), total energy and
    sugar intakes, calcium intake, socioeconomic status, milk and dietary supplement
    consumption, and physical activity, was applied to investigate the association
    between serum 25(OH)D and LTL.Results: In the total population, age, sex, BMI,
    and non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity were significant predictors of LTL. In the
    participants aged 40-59 y, an increment in serum 25(OH)D of 10 nmol/L was associated
    with a 0.03- ± 0.01-kbp longer LTL, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
    other factors (P = 0.001). In the same age group, 25(OH)D concentrations ≥50 nmol/L
    were associated with a 0.13- ± 0.04-kbp longer LTL than those for 25(OH)D concentrations
    {\textless}50 nmol/L (P = 0.01). The association was independent of age, sex,
    race/ethnicity, BMI, and other factors.Conclusions: In a nationally representative
    population of adults, serum 25(OH)D was positively associated with LTL in middle-aged
    participants (aged 40-59 y), independently of other factors. These findings suggest
    that decreased 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with genomic instability,
    although the clinical impact of this observation remains unclear.'

- abstract: 'Background: Several reports suggest potential cytotoxic effects of creatine,
    possibly due to its role in facilitating the formation of food-borne chemical
    carcinogenic compounds. Aim: This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the
    relationship between creatine consumption and various carcinogenic biomarkers
    in blood and urine among individuals aged 18 years and older, utilizing data from
    the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods:
    Daily creatine intake was assessed using the Dietary Data databases, which were
    compiled from individual in-person 24-h food recall interviews. The concentrations
    of carcinogenic compounds (heterocyclic amines, acrylamide, and formaldehyde)
    were extracted from NHANES 2013-2014 Laboratory Data database. Results: The final
    analysis included 1763 adult respondents, of whom 907 (51.4\%) were female. The
    mean daily creatine intake was 0.83 ± 0.77 grams (95\% CI, from 0.80 to 0.87).
    Regression analysis revealed no significant relationship between daily creatine
    intake and most carcinogenic biomarkers, except for a significant correlation
    (Model 1) between creatine intake and acrylamide levels (B = -3.999, ß = -0.088,
    p = 0.05). Model 2 (demographics) confirmed a significant relationship between
    daily creatine intake and circulating acrylamide (B = -3.490, ß = -0.077, p =
    0.02), as well as for blood levels of glycidamide (B = -2.992, ß = -0.068, p =
    0.05) and urinary 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (B = 0.190,
    ß = 0.088, p = 0.03). However, no correlation between creatine consumption and
    any carcinogenic biomarkers remained significant after adjusting for nutritional
    factors (Model 3) (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, the consumption
    of dietary creatine may be considered safe and not associated with increased levels
    of above carcinogens in the general population.'

- abstract: Folate and vitamin B(12) are essential for a variety of metabolic processes.
    Both micronutrients have been shown to reduce oxidative stress significantly.
    The present cross-sectional investigation evaluated the association between serum
    and dietary folate and vitamin B(12) levels and leukocyte telomere length, an
    index of cellular aging influenced by oxidative stress. The study included 5581
    adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Because
    participants were randomly selected, results are generalizable to all civilian,
    noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. A blood draw provided DNA and serum folate and
    B(12) information. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used
    to measure telomere length. The Bio-Rad Quantaphase II folate and vitamin B(12)
    radioassay kit was used to quantify levels of folate and vitamin B(12). Dietary
    folate and vitamin B(12) were assessed using a multipass 24 h recall. In some
    models, age, race, smoking pack-years, alcohol use, body mass index, total physical
    activity, hours fasted before the blood draw, and diabetes status were employed
    as covariates to minimize their influence. Findings showed that for each additional
    year of chronological age, telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter, on average
    (F = 378.8, p {\textless} 0.0001). Men had shorter telomeres than women after
    adjusting for all the covariates (F = 6.8, p = 0.0146). Serum (F = 10.5, p = 0.0030)
    and dietary (F = 5.0, p = 0.0325) folate concentrations were each linearly related
    to telomere length in women, but not in men, after controlling for age and race.
    Serum vitamin B(12) and telomere length had a nonsignificant, inverse relationship
    in women, with age and race controlled (F = 2.8, p = 0.1056), but no relation
    in men. Dietary vitamin B(12) was linearly related to telomere length in women,
    after adjusting for age and race (F = 4.3, p = 0.0468), but not in men. Overall,
    evidence indicates that folate and vitamin B(12) levels, especially folate, account
    for meaningful differences in cell aging in women, but not in men.

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To explore influence of carbohydrates/fat proportions, dietary
    ingredients on telomere length shortening, oxidative stress and inflammation in
    a Chinese population with different glucose tolerance status. METHODS: Five hundred
    and fifty-six Chinese subjects without diabetes history underwent a 75 g, 2 h
    Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Subjects with diabetes (n = 159), pre-diabetes
    (n = 197), and normal glucose tolerance (n = 200) were screened. Dietary intakes
    were evaluated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Peripheral
    blood leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was assessed using a real-time PCR assay.
    Blood lipid profile, levels of the oxidative stress indicators superoxide dismutase
    (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), 8-oxo-2''-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) and inflammation
    indicators tumor necrosis factor (TNF-ɑ), interleukine-6 (IL-6) were measured.
    Levels of HbA1c, plasma glucose, insulin, and C peptide were also determined.
    Measurements were taken at 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min after 75 g OGTT.
    Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by HOMA-IR. Basal insulin secretion index (HOMA-β),
    early phase disposition index (DI30) and total phase disposition index (DI120)
    indicate insulin levels at different phases of insulin secretion. RESULTS: In
    patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, LTL adjusted by age was longer in HbA1c
    {\textless} 7 \% group (log (LTL):1.93 ± 0.25) than in HbA1c ≥ 7 \% group (log
    (LTL):1.82 ± 0.29). LTL was not associated with daily energy intake, diet fat,
    carbohydrates and protein proportions. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated
    that legumes, nuts, fish and seaweeds were protective factors for LTL shortening,
    and sweetened carbonated beverage was a risk factor for LTL shortening ( legumes:
    β = 0.105, p = 0.018; nuts: β = 0.110, p = 0.011; fish: β = 0.118, p = 0.007;
    seaweeds: β = 0.116, p = 0.009; sweetened carbonated beverage: β = -0.120, p =
    0.004 ). Daily energy intake was positively associated with TNF-ɑ, IL-6 (TNF-ɑ:
    r = 0.125, p = 0.006;IL-6: r = 0.092, p =0.04). Fat, carbohydrate proportions
    were positively associated with TNF-ɑ (fat: r = 0.119, p = 0.008 ; carbohydrate:
    r = 0.094, p = 0.043). Seaweeds and dairy intake were negatively associated with
    8-oxo-dG (seaweed: r = -0.496, p = 0.001;dairy: r = -0.246, p = 0.046 ), vegetables
    and fruits were positively associated with GR ( vegetables: r = 0.101, p = 0.034;fruits:
    r = 0.125, p = 0.045). Cereal, meat were positively associated with TNF-ɑ ( cereal:
    r = 0.091, p = 0.048 ; meat: r = 0.405, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Diabetes patients
    with better plasma glucose (HbA1c {\textless} 7 \%) had longer LTL, LTL could
    reflect plasma glucose status in diabetes patients. LTL were probably not influenced
    by diet carbohydrates/fat proportions but was associated with diet ingredients.
    Diet ingredients significantly impacted on markers of inflammation and oxidative
    stress, which probably had an effect on LTL.'

- abstract: 'Cadmium and lead are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that might
    increase risks of cardiovascular disease and other aging-related diseases, but
    their relationships with leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a marker of cellular
    aging, are poorly understood. In experimental studies, they have been shown to
    induce telomere shortening, but no epidemiologic study to date has examined their
    associations with LTL in the general population. We examined associations of blood
    lead and cadmium (n = 6,796) and urine cadmium (n = 2,093) levels with LTL among
    a nationally representative sample of US adults from the National Health and Nutrition
    Examination Survey (1999-2002). The study population geometric mean concentrations
    were 1.67 µg/dL (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.63, 1.70) for blood lead, 0.44
    µg/L (95\% CI: 0.42, 0.47) for blood cadmium, and 0.28 µg/L (95\% CI: 0.27, 0.30)
    for urine cadmium. After adjustment for potential confounders, the highest (versus
    lowest) quartiles of blood and urine cadmium were associated with -5.54\% (95\%
    CI: -8.70, -2.37) and -4.50\% (95\% CI: -8.79, -0.20) shorter LTLs, respectively,
    with evidence of dose-response relationship (P for trend {\textless} 0.05). There
    was no association between blood lead concentration and LTL. These findings provide
    further evidence of physiological impacts of cadmium at environmental levels and
    might provide insight into biological pathways underlying cadmium toxicity and
    chronic disease risks.'

- abstract: 'Background: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker of the aging
    process and is associated with the risk of chronic disease. Higher exposure to
    cadmium may be associated with shorter LTL, and adequate nutrient concentrations
    may be associated with longer LTL; however, the potential interaction between
    metals and nutrients on LTL has yet to be examined.Objectives: The objective of
    this study was to evaluate whether serum concentrations of vitamins and carotenoids
    were associated with LTL, and whether they modified the association between blood
    cadmium and LTL in the US NHANES (1999-2002).Methods: We evaluated cross-sectional
    associations between LTL and serum concentrations of vitamin A, γ-tocopherol,
    α-tocopherol, folate, and vitamin B-12 (1999-2002; n = 7458) and α-carotene, β-carotene,
    β-cryptoxanthin, lutein + zeaxanthin, and lycopene (2001-2002; n = 4018) in a
    nationally representative sample of US adults (≥20 y of age) with the use of multivariable
    linear regression. We further investigated whether vitamin and carotenoid concentrations
    modified associations between blood cadmium and LTL with models stratified by
    serum nutrient concentrations and the inclusion of an interaction term.Results:
    Blood cadmium was inversely associated with LTL (percentage of LTL difference
    per 1 μg/L = -3.74; 95\% CI: -5.35, -2.10). Serum vitamin A was positively associated
    (percentage of LTL difference per 1 μg/L = 4.01; 95\% CI: 0.26, 7.90) and γ-tocopherol
    was inversely associated (percentage of LTL difference per 1 μg/dL = -2.49; 95\%
    CI: -4.21, -0.73) with LTL. Serum folate (P-trend = 0.06) and α-tocopherol (P-trend
    = 0.10) were marginally positively associated with LTL, whereas vitamin B-12 (P-trend
    = 0.78) was not associated with LTL. Serum carotenoids were generally positively
    associated with LTL. Serum vitamin and carotenoid concentrations did not modify
    blood cadmium and LTL associations (P-interaction {\textgreater} 0.10).Conclusions:
    Results from this cross-sectional study suggest that exposure to cadmium and certain
    nutrients may be associated with LTL in US adults, but the serum concentrations
    of the vitamins and carotenoids evaluated did not modify cross-sectional associations
    between cadmium exposure and LTL.'

- abstract: To assess if there is an association between socioeconomic status and
    quality of life, functional status and markers of aging, we studied 86 women aged
    73 ± 7 years, who answered the WHO Qol Bref quality of life survey. Mini mental
    state examination, timed up and go test, 12 minutes' walk, hand grip and quadriceps
    strength, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), carotid intima-media thickness and
    telomere length in peripheral leukocytes were measured. Successful aging was defined
    as a walking speed, handgrip strength, appendicular lean body mass, timed up and
    go and minimental values above cutoff points for disability. Participants with
    successful aging had a higher quality of life score and were more likely to live
    in rich municipalities. There was a positive correlation between telomere length,
    right handgrip strength and total fat free mass. Therefore, there is an association
    between socioeconomic status, successful aging and quality of life.

- abstract: 'Background: Preclinical studies have suggested that dietary creatine
    may affect sleep quality yet no studies have explored the potential association
    between creatine consumption and sleep patterns or disorders in the general population.
    Aim: This cross-sectional study aims to examine the association between creatine
    consumption and sleep habits and disorders among individuals aged 16 years and
    older, using data from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES). Methods: The analysis included 5988 individuals (50.5\% females)
    with a mean age of 47.4 ± 19.5 years. Daily creatine intake was assessed through
    individual in-person 24-h food recall interviews, categorizing respondents into
    two groups: those with suboptimal creatine intake ({\textless}1.00 g per day)
    and those meeting recommended intake (dietary creatine ≥ 1.00 g per day). Sleep
    was evaluated during household interviews using questions on sleep habits and
    disorders from the NHANES Sleep Disorders component. Results: The average daily
    creatine intake among participants was 0.88 ± 0.85 g (95\% CI, 0.86 to 0.90),
    while the mean nightly sleep duration was 6.8 ± 1.5 h (95\% CI, 6.8 to 6.9). Additionally,
    1331 respondents (22.2\%) reported consulting a doctor or health professional
    for sleep-related issues. Participants with suboptimal creatine intake had a significantly
    higher prevalence of trouble sleeping compared to those consuming recommended
    amounts (23.7\% vs 19.3\%; P {\textless} 0.01), with an odds ratio of 1.30 (95\%
    CI: 1.13 to 1.48) for experiencing sleep disturbances. However, the prevalence
    of more severe sleep disorders did not differ significantly between the two creatine
    sub-populations (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that
    participants meeting recommended creatine intake levels had a reduced risk of
    experiencing mild sleeping difficulties. These findings may serve as a basis for
    future interventional studies aimed at validating and confirming the potential
    benefits of dietary creatine in the field of sleep medicine.'

- abstract: The field of sedentary behavior epidemiology is emerging. Short leukocyte
    telomere length (LTL) is a hallmark characteristic of aging, but LTL is also associated
    with morbidity and mortality independent of age. To my knowledge, only one study
    has examined the association between sedentary behavior and LTL. The purpose of
    this study was to examine the association between screen-based sedentary behavior
    and LTL. Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
    were used (N=6405; age, 20-84 years). Leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior
    (television, video games, computer use) was assessed via questionnaire, and LTL
    was extracted from DNA in whole blood with the LTL assay performed using quantitative
    polymerase chain reaction. After adjustments (including age and physical activity),
    for every 1-hour increase in leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior, participants
    had a 7\% increased odds (odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.13; P=.04) of having
    LTL in the lowest tertile (vs highest); leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior
    was not associated with values in the middle (vs highest) tertile (odds ratio,
    1.01; 95\% CI, 0.95-1.07; P=.62). The results of this study revealed that greater
    leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior is associated with shorter LTL.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Numerous methods exist to analyze complex environmental mixtures
    in health studies. As an illustration of the different uses of mixture methods,
    we employed methods geared toward distinct research questions concerning persistent
    organic chemicals (POPs) as a mixture and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) as an
    outcome. METHODS: With information on 18 POPs and LTL among 1,003 U.S. adults
    (NHANES, 2001-2002), we used unsupervised methods including clustering to identify
    profiles of similarly exposed participants, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify common exposure patterns. We
    also employed supervised learning techniques, including penalized, weighted quantile
    sum (WQS), and Bayesian kernel machine (BKMR) regressions, to identify potentially
    toxic agents, and characterize nonlinear associations, interactions, and the overall
    mixture effect. RESULTS: Clustering separated participants into high, medium,
    and low POP exposure groups; longer log-LTL was found among those with high exposure.
    The first PCA component represented overall POP exposure and was positively associated
    with log-LTL. Two EFA factors, one representing furans and the other PCBs 126
    and 118, were positively associated with log-LTL. Penalized regression methods
    selected three congeners in common (PCB 126, PCB 118, and furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf)
    as potentially toxic agents. WQS found a positive overall effect of the POP mixture
    and identified six POPs as potentially toxic agents (furans 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hxcdf,
    2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hxcdf, and PCBs 99, 126, 169). BKMR found a positive
    linear association with furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, suggestive evidence of linear associations
    with PCBs 126 and 169, and a positive overall effect of the mixture, but no interactions
    among congeners. CONCLUSIONS: Using different methods, we identified patterns
    of POP exposure, potentially toxic agents, the absence of interaction, and estimated
    the overall mixture effect. These applications and results may serve as a guide
    for mixture method selection based on specific research questions.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Biological processes of aging are thought to be modifiable
    causes of many different chronic diseases. Measures of biological aging could
    provide sensitive endpoints for studies of risk factors hypothesized to shorten
    healthy lifespan and/or interventions that extend it. But uncertainty remains
    about how to measure biological aging and if proposed measures assess the same
    thing. METHOD: We tested four proposed measures of biological aging that could
    be quantified with available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
    Survey (NHANES), Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation,
    Levine Method (LM) Biological Age, and leukocyte telomere length. RESULTS: We
    analyzed data collected during 1999-2002, when all four biological aging meausres
    could be taken. Participants'' KDM biological ages, homeostatic dysregulation
    levels, LM biological ages, and telomere length were all correlated with their
    chronological ages. KDM Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation, and LM Biological
    Age were all correlated with one another, but these measures were uncorrelated
    with telomere length. Participants'' with more advanced biological aging performed
    worse on tests of physical, cognitive, and perceptual functioning and reported
    more limitations to their daily activities and more pain, and rated themselves
    as being in worse health. In parallel, participants with risk factors for shorter
    healthy lifespan exhibited more advanced biological aging. In both sets of analyses,
    effect-sizes tended to be larger for KDM Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation,
    and LM Biological Age as compared to telomere length. DISCUSSION: The cellular-level
    aging biomarker telomere length may measure different aspects of the aging process
    as compared to the patient-level physiological composite measures KDM Biological
    Age, homeostatic dysregulation, and LM Biological Age. Studies aiming to test
    if risk factors accelerate aging or if interventions may slow aging should not
    treat proposed measures of aging as interchangeable.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Identifying the impact of environmental mixtures on human
    health is an important topic. However, such studies face challenges when exposure
    measurements lie below limit of detection (LOD). While various approaches for
    accommodating a single exposure subject to LOD have been used, their impact on
    mixture analysis has not been thoroughly investigated. Our study aims to understand
    the impact of five popular LOD accommodation approaches on mixture analysis results
    with multiple exposures subject to LOD, including omitting subjects with any exposures
    below LOD (complete case analysis); single imputations by LOD/ [Formula: see text]
    , and by estimates from a censored accelerated failure time (AFT) model; and multiple
    imputation (MI) with or without truncation based on LOD. METHODS: In extensive
    simulation studies with high-dimensional and highly correlated exposures and a
    continuous health outcome, we examined the performance of each LOD approach on
    three mixture analysis methods: elastic net regression, weighted quantile sum
    regression (WQS) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). We further analyzed
    data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on how
    persistent organic pollutants (POPs) influenced leukocyte telomere length (LTL).
    RESULTS: Complete case analysis was inefficient and could result in severe bias
    for some mixture methods. Imputation by LOD/ [Formula: see text] showed unstable
    performance across mixture methods. Conventional MI was associated with consistent
    mild biases, which can be reduced by using a truncated distribution for imputation.
    Estimating censored values by AFT models had a minimal impact on the results.
    In the NHANES analysis, imputation by LOD/ [Formula: see text] , truncated MI
    and censored AFT models performed similarly, with a positive overall effect of
    POPs on LTL while PCB126, PCB169 and furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf being the most important
    exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Our study favored using truncated MI and censored AFT
    models to accommodate values below LOD for the stability of downstream mixture
    analysis.'

- abstract: 'Dietary factors, including dietary fat, may affect the biological aging
    process, as reflected by the shortening of telomere length (TL), by affecting
    levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. We examined the direct
    relations of total and types of dietary fats and fat-rich foods to peripheral
    leukocyte TL. In 4029 apparently healthy postmenopausal women who participated
    in the Women''s Health Initiative, intakes of total fat, individual fatty acids,
    and fat-rich foods were assessed by a questionnaire. TL was measured by quantitative
    polymerase chain reaction. Intake of short-to-medium-chain saturated fatty acids
    (SMSFAs; aliphatic tails of ≤ 12 carbons) was inversely associated with TL. Compared
    with participants in other quartiles of SMSFA intake, women who were in the highest
    quartile (median: 1.29\% of energy) had shorter TLs [mean: 4.00 kb (95\% CI: 3.89,
    4.11 kb)], whereas women in the lowest quartile of intake (median: 0.29\% of energy)
    had longer TLs [mean: 4.13 kb (95\% CI: 4.03, 4.24 kb); P-trend = 0.046]. Except
    for lauric acid, all other individual SMSFAs were inversely associated with TL
    (P {\textless} 0.05). In isoenergetic substitution models, the substitution of
    1\% of energy from SMSFAs with any other energy source was associated with 119
    bp longer TLs (95\% CI: 21, 216 bp). Intakes of nonskim milk, butter, and whole-milk
    cheese (major sources of SMSFAs) were all inversely associated with TL. No significant
    associations were found with long-chain saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated
    fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In conclusion, we found that higher
    intakes of SMSFAs and SMSFA-rich foods were associated with shorter peripheral
    leukocyte TL among postmenopausal women. These findings suggest the potential
    roles of SMSFAs in the rate of biological aging.'

- abstract: Sarcopenia is defined as aging-related loss of muscle mass and function.
    Telomere length in chromosomes shortens with age and is modulated by telomeric
    repeat-containing RNA (TERRA). This study aimed to explore the impact of aging
    and sarcopenia on telomere length and TERRA expression, and changes following
    strengthening exercise and nutrition intervention (supplement of branched-chain
    amino acids, calcium and vitamin D3) for 12 weeks in the sarcopenic population.
    Older adults (≥65 years old) were divided into non-sarcopenic controls (n = 36)
    and sarcopenic individuals (n = 36) after measurement of grip strength and body
    composition. The relative telomere length of leukocytes in all research participants
    was evaluated using the T/S ratio (telomere/single copy gene), and relative TERRA
    expression of leukocytes was determined by reverse-transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR).
    Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to analyze the influence of sarcopenia
    and intervention on the outcomes. There was no significant difference in telomere
    length between control subjects and participants with sarcopenia. TERRA expression
    was lower in sarcopenic participants compared to that in non-sarcopenic controls
    (5.18 ± 2.98 vs. 2.51 ± 1.89; p {\textless} 0.001). In the sarcopenic group, intervention
    significantly increased TERRA expression, but not telomere length. The GEE analysis
    demonstrated that TERRA expression was negatively associated with sarcopenia (β
    coefficient = -2.705, p {\textless} 0.001) but positively associated with intervention
    (β coefficient = 1.599, p = 0.023). Sarcopenia is associated with a decrease in
    TERRA expression in leukocytes. Rebound TERRA expression (returning to the level
    similar to the non-sarcopenic controls) was observed in the sarcopenic group after
    exercise and nutrition intervention. Future studies are warranted to examine the
    potential of TERRA as a biomarker for sarcopenia and its subsequent responses
    to intervention.

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The associations between individual cardiovascular disease
    risk factors and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) have been inconclusive. We investigated
    the association between LTL and overall cardiovascular health (CVH) as defined
    by the American Heart Association and whether the association is modified by sex
    and race/ethnicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 5194 adults (aged ≥20) from
    the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. CVH was defined
    as a composite score of the 7 metrics (smoking, physical activity, diet, body
    mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose) and
    categorized as "poor," "intermediate," and "ideal." LTL was assayed from whole
    blood using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method relative to standard
    reference DNA. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the
    association between CVH and log-transformed LTL. We found strong graded association
    between CVH and LTL in the overall sample, with evidence of dose-response relationship
    (P for trend=0.013). Individuals with poor and intermediate CVH had significantly
    shorter LTL than individuals with ideal CVH (-3.4\% [95\% CI=-6.0\%, -0.8\%] and
    -2.4\% [-4.4\%, -0.3\%], respectively), after adjustment for demographic variables,
    socioeconomic status, and C-reactive protein. The association was stronger in
    women (-6.6\% [-10.2\%, -2.9\%] for poor vs ideal CVH) and non-Hispanic whites
    (-4.3\% [-7.1\%, -1.4\%] for poor vs ideal CVH). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest
    that less-than-ideal CVH is associated with shorter LTL, but this association
    varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Future longitudinal research is needed to elucidate
    the mechanisms that underlie the association between CVH and LTL.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences (TTAGGG) and
    their associated proteins at the end of eukaryote chromosomes. Telomere length
    shortens throughout the lifespan with each cell division, and leukocyte telomere
    length (LTL) is often used as a biomarker of cellular aging. LTL is related to
    many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However,
    to our knowledge, the relation between LTL and risk factors for cardiovascular
    disease and diabetes, such as dietary intake of processed meat and unprocessed
    red meat, is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of processed
    meat intake and unprocessed red meat intake with LTL. METHODS: This cross-sectional
    study comprised 2846 American Indians from the Strong Heart Family Study who participated
    in the 2001-2003 examination. Dietary factors, including past-year consumption
    of processed meat and unprocessed red meat, were assessed with the use of a 119-item
    Block Food-Frequency Questionnaire. LTL was measured with the use of quantitative
    polymerase chain reaction. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine
    the associations of intake of processed meat and unprocessed red meat with LTL.
    RESULTS: Consumption of processed meat was negatively associated with LTL after
    adjustment for age, sex, site, education, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity,
    and other dietary factors. For every additional daily serving of processed meat,
    LTL was 0.021 units (telomeric product-to-single-copy gene ratio) shorter (β ±
    SE = -0.021 ± 0.008, P = 0.009). No association was observed between the intake
    of unprocessed red meat and LTL (β ± SE = 0.008 ± 0.011, P = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS:
    In the Strong Heart Family Study, consumption of processed meat, but not unprocessed
    red meat, was associated with shorter LTL, a potential mediator for several age-related
    diseases. Further studies are needed to better understand the biological mechanism
    by which processed meat intake influences cellular aging.'

- abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Equol has been shown to improve skin health and regeneration,
    due to its antioxidative, phytoestrogenic and epigenetic characteristics. The
    effects of a topical intervention on skin structure, telomere length and epigenetic
    markers in skin cells were analysed. METHODS: Sixty-four participants were divided
    in four groups and three of them treated topically with the following: emulsion
    with Equol powder (Isoflavandiol-E-55-RS®); emulsion with microencapsulated Equol
    (Vesisorb® Isoflavandiol-E-55-RS®) and an emulsion with lecithin (Vesisorb® placebo).
    A control group of 6 volunteers did not receive any intervention. The active compound
    was a 0.5\% equol-racemate. For 58 participants, all samples were collected. Structural
    analysis, molecular analysis and questionnaires were performed at the start of
    the study and after 8 weeks of intervention, twice a day. Structural skin parameters
    were analysed by Visioscan® VC 98 and Cutometer® dual MPA 580. Molecular analyses
    from epidermal cells collected by skin stripping of the forehead included telomere
    length and LINE-1 methylation, following DNA extraction, bisulfite conversion
    and qPCR as well as high-resolution melting curve analysis. Effects of nutrition
    and lifestyle habits were evaluated with a standardized food and lifestyle questionnaire.
    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The surface analysis showed significant improvements in
    skin roughness, skin texture and skin smoothness after both interventions. Cutometer®
    dual MPA 580 measurement revealed improvement of skin firmness and elasticity
    parameters for both preparations. A decrease in mean LINE-1 methylation (n.s.)
    and telomere length (sign. P {\textless} 0.05) was observed in the sample group
    with age. In the treated groups, significantly longer telomeres were observed
    after intervention. Whether changes in telomere length reflect changes in the
    regulation of telomerase, epigenetic interactions or turnover of keratinocytes
    needs further research. Stability and availability of preparations in skin seems
    to be high as not many significant differences in the activity of pure or encapsulated
    substances were seen. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that equol
    has beneficial effects on structural as well as molecular skin parameters and
    encourages further investigations to decipher the epigenetic regulation of skin
    ageing and interactions of equol.'

- abstract: Variable importance is a key statistical issue in exposure mixtures, as
    it allows a ranking of exposures as potential targets for intervention, and helps
    to identify bad actors within a mixture. In settings where mixtures have many
    constituents or high between-constituent correlations, estimators of importance
    can be subject to bias or high variance. Current approaches to assessing variable
    importance have major limitations, including reliance on overly strong or incorrect
    constraints or assumptions, excessive model extrapolation, or poor interpretability,
    especially regarding practical significance. We sought to overcome these limitations
    by applying an established doubly-robust, machine learning-based approach to estimating
    variable importance in a mixtures context. This method reduces model extrapolation,
    appropriately controls confounding, and provides both interpretability and model
    flexibility. We illustrate its use with an evaluation of the relationship between
    telomere length, a measure of biologic aging, and exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated
    biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furans among 979 US adults from the National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In contrast with standard approaches
    for mixtures, our approach selected PCB 180 and PCB 194 as important contributors
    to telomere length. We hypothesize that this difference could be due to residual
    confounding in standard methods that rely on variable selection. Further empirical
    evaluation of this method is needed, but it is a promising tool in the search
    for bad actors within a mixture.

- abstract: 'Age and aging are important predictors of health status, disease progression,
    drug kinetics, and effects. The purpose was to develop ensemble learning-based
    physiological age (PA) models for evaluating drug metabolism. National Health
    and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were modeled with ensemble learning
    to obtain two PA models, PA-M1 and PA-M2. PA-M1 included body composition, blood
    and urine biomarkers, and disease variables as predictors. PA-M2 had blood and
    urine-derived variables as predictors. Activity phenotypes for cytochrome-P450
    (CYP) CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, xanthine oxidase (XO), and N-acetyltransferase-2
    (NAT-2) and telomere attrition were assessed. Bayesian networks were used to obtain
    mechanistic systems pharmacology model structures for PA. The study included n
    = 22,307 NHANES participants (51.5\% female, mean age 46.0 years, range: 18-79
    years). The PA-M1 and PA-M2 distributions had greater dispersion across age strata
    with a right skew for younger age strata and a left skew for older age strata.
    There was no evidence of algorithmic bias based on sex or race/ethnicity. Klotho,
    lean body mass, glycohemoglobin, and systolic blood pressure were the top four
    predictors for PA-M1. Glycohemoglobin, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, and
    urine creatinine were the top four predictors for PA-M2. The models also performed
    satisfactorily in independent validation. Model-predicted PA was associated with
    CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, XO, and NAT-2 activity. Telomere attrition was associated
    with greater PA-M1 and PA-M2. Ensemble learning models provide robust assessments
    of PA from easily obtained blood and urine biomarkers. PA is associated with Phase
    I drug-metabolizing enzyme phenotypes.'

- abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Shorter telomeres are associated with several age-related
    diseases, and lifestyle factors could influence this relationship. The aim of
    this study was to examine associations between salivary telomere length (TL) and
    diet quality using 5 evidence-based dietary indexes in an elderly ({\textgreater}55
    years old) Spanish population of the SUN project (n = 886). METHOD: TL was measured
    using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Age-adjusted TL variable
    through residuals methods was used for all analysis. Diet quality was assessed
    by the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS), Fat Quality Index (FQI), Mediterranean
    Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)
    index and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010). RESULTS: TL did differ
    according to sex, smoking status, and dyslipidemia in elderly subjects of the
    SUN study. In addition, subjects with dyslipidemia (compared to absence of dyslipidemia)
    had a significantly higher risk (27\% vs. 18\%, p = 0.015) of short telomeres
    ({\textless}percentile 20th). Interestingly, a lower risk of having short telomeres
    was observed among participants in the top tertiles of the following diet quality
    score PDQS, MEDAS and DASH compared to the bottom tertiles in crude and adjusted
    models. Moreover, FQI and AHEI-2010 scores showed an inverse association with
    the risk of having short telomeres after adjustment for potential confounders
    (model adjusted for dyslipidemia interaction, p for trend = 0.025 and 0.021, respectively;
    and model additionally adjusted for sex and smoking status, p for trend = 0.033
    and 0.029, respectively). CONCLUSION: Adherence to high quality diet is associated
    to longer salivary TL in our elderly Spanish population of the SUN study.'

- abstract: Social support is associated with better health but it is unknown whether
    the health advantages of social support depend on the support source. Using a
    probability sample of older U.S. adults (n=1430) we compared leukocyte telomere
    length, a biomarker of cellular aging, between married adults whose support sources
    either did or did not include their spouse. Despite having social support from
    other sources, participants who lacked spousal support had shorter telomeres relative
    to those with spousal support. The size of this telomere difference was comparable
    to differences between men and women and was independent of sociodemographic variables,
    coronary heart disease risk, diagnosed chronic disease and other social relationship
    resources such as the number of support sources, the number of friends, or the
    availability of financial support. Our findings suggest that relative to other
    sources of social support, spousal support may be especially important for cellular
    aging, a general biological mechanism that is implicated in age-related chronic
    disease risk.

- abstract: 'PURPOSE: Poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) could lead to higher
    morbidity and mortality through telomere attrition or accelerated cellular aging.
    We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine the relationship between four
    dimensions of HRQOL and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) among a nationally representative
    sample of 3547 US adults (≥20 years) using the data from the 2001-2002 National
    Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. METHOD: We used HRQOL survey information
    collected on individuals'' self-rated general health, recent physical health,
    recent mental health, and recent activity limitation. Telomere length was assessed
    using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Multiple linear regressions were
    used to estimate the relationship between each dimension of HRQOL and log-transformed
    values of LTL with adjustment for sample weights and design effects. RESULTS:
    HRQOL-race interactions were significant, and the results were stratified by race.
    After controlling for demographic factors, disease conditions, and lifestyle variables,
    worse general health was significantly associated with shorter LTL for Blacks
    (coefficient, β: -0.022, 95\% Confidence Interval, 95\% CI: -0.03 to -0.01), but
    not for Whites or Mexican Americans. Unwell physical health was associated with
    shorter telomere length for Whites (β: -0.005, 95\% CI: -0.01 to -0.001) only.
    Unwell mental health showed no significant association with LTL in any race. CONCLUSIONS:
    Although longitudinal studies are needed to prove causality, our findings suggest
    that HRQOL could be associated with LTL shortening. We also found a possible racial
    difference in this association and recommend additional multiethnic studies to
    confirm this and to understand the reasons and consequences of this difference.'

- abstract: 'The aim of the study is to explore the longitudinal association of dietary
    acrylamide exposure with cognitive performance in Chinese elderly. The analysis
    was conducted among 2534 non-smoking elderly men and women based on a prospective
    study, Mr. and Ms. OS Hong Kong. Dietary acrylamide intake was assessed by food
    frequency questionnaires with data on local food contamination, derived from the
    first Hong Kong Total Diet Study. Global cognitive function was assessed by Cantonese
    version of Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) at the baseline and the 4(th) year of
    follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used
    to assess the associations of dietary acrylamide with MMSE score changes or risk
    of poor cognition. The results indicated that among men with MMSE ≥ 18, each one
    SD increase of acrylamide decreased MMSE score by 7.698\% (95\%CI: -14.943\%,
    -0.452\%; p = 0.037). Logistic regression revealed an increased risk of poor cognition
    (MMSE ≤ 26) in men with HR of 3.356 (1.064{\textasciitilde}10.591, p = 0.039).
    The association became non-significance after further adjustment for telomere
    length. No significant association was observed in women. Dietary acrylamide exposure
    was associated with a mild cognitive decline or increased risk of poor cognition
    over a 4-year period in non-smoking Chinese elderly men.'

- abstract: By tracking a group of individuals through time, cohort studies provide
    fundamental insights into the developmental time course and causes of health and
    disease. Evolutionary life history theory seeks to explain patterns of growth,
    development, reproduction and senescence, and inspires a range of hypotheses that
    are testable using the longitudinal data from cohort studies. Here we review two
    decades of life history theory-motivated work conducted in collaboration with
    the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS), a birth cohort study
    that enrolled more than 3000 pregnant women in the Philippines in 1983 and has
    since followed these women, their offspring and grandoffspring. This work has
    provided evidence that reproduction carries "costs" to cellular maintenance functions,
    potentially speeding senescence, and revealed an unusual form of genetic plasticity
    in which the length of telomeres inherited across generations is influenced by
    reproductive timing in paternal ancestors. Men in Cebu experience hormonal and
    behavioural changes in conjunction with changes in relationship and fatherhood
    status that are consistent with predictions based upon other species that practice
    bi-parental care. The theoretical expectation that early life cues of mortality
    or environmental unpredictability will motivate a "fast" life history strategy
    are confirmed for behavioural components of reproductive decision making, but
    not for maturational tempo, while our work points to a broader capacity for early
    life developmental calibration of systems like immunity, reproductive biology
    and metabolism. Our CLHNS findings illustrate the power of life history theory
    as an integrative, lifecourse framework to guide longitudinal studies of human
    populations.
