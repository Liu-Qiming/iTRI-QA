	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Even though cadmium (Cd) exposure and cellular senescence (telomere length) have been linked in previous studies, composite molecular aging  biomarkers are more significant and reliable factors to consider when examining  the connection between metal exposure and health outcomes. The purpose of this  research was to assess the association between urinary cadmium (U-Cd) and  whole-body aging (phenotypic age). METHODS: Phenotypic age was calculated from  chronological age and 9 molecular biomarkers. Multivariate linear regression  models, subgroup analysis, and smoothing curve fitting were used to explore the  linear and nonlinear relationship between U-Cd and phenotypic age. Mediation  analysis was performed to explore the mediating effect of U-Cd on the association  between smoking and phenotypic age. RESULTS: This study included 10,083  participants with a mean chronological age and a mean phenotypic age of 42.24  years and 42.34 years, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, there was a  positive relationship between U-Cd and phenotypic age [2.13 years per 1 ng/g  U-Cd, (1.67, 2.58)]. This association differed by sex, age, and smoking subgroups  (P for interaction {\textless} 0.05). U-Cd mediated a positive association between serum  cotinine and phenotypic age, mediating a proportion of 23.2\%. CONCLUSIONS: Our  results suggest that high levels of Cd exposure are associated with whole-body  aging.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a worldwide public health concern, mainly afflicting older adults. Although the etiology of OA remains unclear,  environmental factors are increasingly considered as non-negligible risk factors.  This study aims to evaluate the associations of urinary metals with OA risk and  the mediated effect of biological aging. METHODS: Nine urinary metal  concentrations were detected among 12,584 U.S. adults based on the National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), including barium (Ba), cadmium  (Cd), cobalt (Co), cesium (Cs), molybdenum (Mo), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb),  thallium (Tl), and uranium (Tu). Multivariable logistic regression and weighted  quantile sum (WQS) regression were used to explore the associations of single  metal and mixed metals with OA risk, respectively. Furthermore, biological aging  was measured from different perspectives, including cell senescence (telomere  length) and whole-body aging (phenotypic age and biological age). Mediation  analyses were conducted to investigate the mediated effects of aging on the  associations of metals with OA risk. RESULTS: In the single-exposure model, Cd,  Co, and Cs were identified to be positively associated with OA risk, with odds  ratios (OR) ranging from 1.48 to 1.64 (all P {\textless} 0.05). Mixed-exposure analyses  showed consistent associations (OR 1.23, 95\%CI 1.10 to 1.37) and highlighted that  Cd, Co, and Cs were responsible for the outcomes. Additionally, Cd, Co, Cs, Pb,  and Tl were positively associated with biological aging markers, while all  biological aging markers had significant associations with OA risk. Further  mediation analyses showed that the associations of single metal (mainly Cd and  Cs) and mixed metals with OA risk parallelly mediated by the above biological  aging markers, with the proportion of mediation ranging from 16.89 to 69.39\% (all  P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, such associations were also serially mediated through  telomere length-biological age path and telomere length-phenotypic age path (the  proportion of mediation: 4.17-11.67\%), indicating that metals accelerated cell  senescence to lead to whole-body aging and finally aggravated OA progress.  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that exposure to metals increased OA risk,  which was possibly and partly mediated by biological aging.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an important biomarker of aging. The oxidative balance score (OBS) is used to assess the oxidative stress-related  exposures of diet and lifestyle. This study is aimed at exploring if the OBS was  associated with LTL. METHODS: 3220 adults were included in this study from the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. LTL was  assayed from leukocyte DNA. Twenty dietary and lifestyle factors were selected to  score the OBS. Survey-based multivariable linear regression was conducted to  assess the association between the OBS and log-transformed LTL. RESULTS: The  association between the OBS and log-transformed LTL was positive in females but  not males. For females, compared with the lowest OBS category as a reference, the  multivariable-adjusted beta estimate (95\% confidence interval, CI) for the  highest OBS category was 0.0701 (0.0205-0.1197) (p for trend {\textless} 0.01), and the  multivariable-adjusted beta estimate (95\% CI) of the continuous OBS was 0.0039  (0.0014-0.0065). There was also the gender difference in the correlations of the  dietary OBS and the lifestyle OBS with log-transformed LTL. CONCLUSION: There was  a positive association between the OBS and LTL in females. This result suggested  that diet and lifestyle might affect LTL by regulating oxidative balance.},

	abstract = {Physiologic aging leads to attrition of telomeres and replicative senescence. An acceleration of this process has been hypothesized in the progression of chronic  liver disease. We sought to examine the association of telomere length (TL) with  liver disease and its impact on mortality risk. A cohort of 7,072 adults with  leukocyte TL measurements from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey 1999-2002 with mortality follow-up through 2015 was analyzed. Liver  disease was defined by aminotransferase levels and classified into etiology-based  and advanced fibrosis categories. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models  estimated effect sizes, with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), of the presence of  liver disease on TL. Cox regression models evaluated associations between TL and  all-cause mortality risk using adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). The cohort was  representative of the US population with mean age 46.1 years and mean TL 5.79  kilobase pairs. No overall association between TL and liver disease was found;  however, there was a significant negative association of TL and advanced liver  fibrosis in individuals aged 65 and above. The liver disease cohort (HR 1.22, 95\%  CI 0.99-1.51) and those with metabolic syndrome (HR 1.26, 95\% CI 0.96-1.67) had  increased mortality risk with shorter TL. The relationship between TL and  all-cause mortality was stronger in women (HR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.02-2.23) and in  non-Hispanic Whites (HR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.02-1.84). Conclusion: Shortened leukocyte  TL is independently associated with advanced liver disease at older ages, and  with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in those with liver disease. These  associations reaffirm the need to better understand the role of telomeres in the  progression of liver disease.},

This study aimed to investigate the association between telomere  length and long-term all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)  mortality, in individuals with MetS in the United States. METHODS: A total of  1980 participants with MetS aged 18 years or older from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) prospective cohort study (1999-2002) were  included in this cohort study. Medical records review was used to identify the  cause of deaths as of December 2018. We employed Kaplan-Meier curves, fitted  curves, and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios  (HRs) for all-cause and CVD mortality, stratified by tertiles of LTL. RESULTS:  Over a median follow-up of 17.75 years of participants with metabolic syndrome,  819 deaths occurred, including 231 cardiovascular deaths. After adjusting for  multiple covariates, participants with shorter telomere length had a  significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.6) and  CVD mortality (HR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.93) compared with those in the highest  tertile of telomere length. All-cause mortality (P {\textless} 0.001) and cardiovascular  disease mortality (P = 0.028) followed a similar pattern across tertiles of  telomere length. CONCLUSION: In individuals with MetS, shorter telomere length is  associated with increased risks of death from cardiovascular disease and all  causes. The underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these findings  require additional investigation.},

Telomere shortening has been associated with sarcopenia and  obesity alone but the association between SO and telomere length (TL) has not  been investigated. This study aimed to investigate SO and TL in an adult  population. Data were from 5397 individuals (mean age = 44.7 years, 51.3\% male)  enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Body  composition (BC) was assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Two models  were used to assess SO: a BC model including four phenotypes derived from the  combination of high or low adiposity and muscle mass; and, a truncal fat mass to  appendicular skeletal mass ratio (TrFM/ASM). TL was assessed using quantitative  polymerase chain reaction and expressed as base pairs. The mean TL, relative to  the reference DNA, was calculated and expressed as the mean T/S ratio. A General  Linear Model was applied to determine associations between TL for SO. In adjusted  analysis, only individuals with SO, defined as the presence of high adiposity-low  muscle mass (four-phenotype model), had significantly shorter telomeres  (p = 0.05) than the reference group (i.e. low adiposity-high muscle mass), with a  mean T/S ratio of 1.02 (95\%CI: 0.98-1.05) compared to 1.05 (95\%CI: 1.01-1.09),  respectively. TrFM/ASM was not associated with TL. Preliminary findings suggest  that sarcopenia and obesity may act synergistically to shorten telomeres.},

Telomere length (TL) has been  proposed as a biomarker of aging. However, the relationship between body  composition, fractures, and TL has rarely been studied. Therefore, this study  aimed to investigate the correlation between TL and body composition and  fractures.Patients and methods: 20950 participants from the 2001-2002 National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in the final  analysis. In NHANES, body compositions were measured with DXA, and TL was  determined with quantitative PCR. Correlation analysis of TL and body composition  was conducted using multivariate weighted linear regression and logistic  regression models. RESULTS: The results showed that TL positively correlated with  bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in most body parts.  However, BMD and BMC were negatively connected with TL in the upper limbs and  skull. Fat content was negatively associated with TL, while muscle content was  positively linked to TL. In addition, TL's trend analysis results were consistent  with the regression model when transformed from a continuous to a classified  variable. An increase in TL was associated with a higher incidence of wrist  fractures, while a decrease in spine fractures. The above correlation also has a  certain degree of sex specificity. CONCLUSION: Our study indicate that TL is  associated with body composition as well as fractures, but further research is  needed to confirm these contrasting associations in the skull, upper limbs, and  wrists.},

The cross-sectional investigation analyzed  data from 3479 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES) conducted from 1999 to 2000. To inspect linear and nonlinear  correlations, we adopted weighted multiple logistic regression analysis and  smooth curve fit, respectively. In addition, threshold effects and subgroup  analyses were accomplished. In the fully adapted model, a significant adverse  association of WWI with telomere length was detected [β = -0.02, 95\% CI: (-0.03,  -0.00), P value = 0.01]. The adverse correlation remained consistent across all  subcategories. We also discovered an inverted U-shaped curve linking WWI and  telomere length, with a conspicuous inflection point of 10.07 cm/√kg. For the  first time, our research demonstrated strong links between WWI and telomere  length.

A total of 1460 adults over the age of 20 years  provided urine information on 8 PAHs and selected covariates from the 2001-2002  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Bayesian nuclear  machine regression (BKMR) was conducted to analyze these associations of telomere  length in multiple PAH-exposed environments. Linear regression is mainly used for  correlation analysis of PAHs with selected covariate adjustments. Restricted  cubic spline (RCS) is used to estimate the correlation between selected PAHs and  telomere length. After adjusting for potential covariates, PAHs mixed exposure  was negatively associated with telomere length. The linear regression results  showed that 2-napthol and 2-fluorene were negatively correlated with telomere  length. Telomere length decreased by 1.0\% in the fully adjusted model per  increment of one unit in the base-10-logarithm-transformed 2-napthol and  2-fluorene concentrations (P = 0.030 and 0.049, respectively). However, the other  6 PAH metabolites were not significantly different. In addition, RCS results  showed that 2-napthol has a marginal dose effect relationship with telomere  length. Our present study suggested that PAHs are negatively associated with  telomere length in the general population of the USA. Considering that the low  level of PAHs exposure in the general population can also induce reduced telomere  length and potential health risks, future research is needed to explore potential  mechanisms.},

RESULTS:  During the average follow-up time of 204.10 ± 51.26 months, 33 (0.45\%)  participants died from influenza and pneumonia. After adjusting for multiple  variables, shorter TL was associated with higher influenza-pneumonia mortality.  In subgroup analyses stratified by sex, men exhibited stronger associations with  influenza-pneumonia mortality than women (Model 1: HR(male): 0.014 vs HR(female):  0.054; Model 2: HR(male): 0.082 vs HR(female): 0.890; Model 3: HR(male): 0.072 vs  HR(female): 0.776).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are endocrine disrupting chemicals that have myriad effects on human physiology. Estrogenic PFASs may  influence biological aging by mimicking the activity of endogenous estrogens,  which can decrease inflammation and oxidative stress and enhance telomerase  activity. We hypothesized that PFAS exposure would be differentially associated  with measures of biological aging based on biological sex and reproductive stage.  METHODS: We analyzed associations between serum PFAS levels and measures of  biological aging for pre- and postmenopausal women and men (n = 3193) using data  from the 2003 to 2018 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey. Examining PFASs both individually and in mixture models, we investigated  four measures of clinical aging (Homeostatic Dysregulation, the Klemera-Doubal  Method, Phenotypic Age Acceleration, and Allostatic Load), oxidative stress, and  telomere length. RESULTS: PFOA and PFOS were negatively associated with  Phenotypic Age Acceleration (e.g. decelerated aging) for men B = -0.22, 95\% CI:  -0.32, -0.12; B = -0.04, 95\% CI: -0.06, -0.03) , premenopausal women (B = -0.58,  95\% CI: -0.83, -0.32; B = -0.15, 95\% CI: -0.20, -0.09), and postmenopausal women  (B= -0.22, 95\% CI: -0.43, -0.01; B = -0.05, 95\% CI: -0.08, -0.02). In mixture  models, we found net negative effects for Phenotypic Age Acceleration and  Allostatic Load for men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women. We also  found significant mixture effects for the antioxidants bilirubin and albumin  among the three sample groups. We found no evidence to support effects on  telomere length. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure may be  inversely associated with some measures of biological aging at the relatively low  levels of exposure in this sample, regardless of reproductive stage and sex,  which does not support our hypothesis. This research provides insights into how  PFAS exposure may variably influence aging measures depending on the  physiological process investigated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the correlation between lipoproteins and telomere length in US adults is limited. We aimed to investigate whether lipoproteins was  associated with telomere length using US National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) database. METHODS: A total of 6468 selected  participants were identified in the NHANES Data Base (1999-2002). The independent  and dependent variables were lipoproteins and telomere length, respectively. The  covariates included demographic data, dietary data, physical examination data,  and comorbidities. RESULTS: In fully-adjusted model, we found that 0.1  differences of telomere length were positively associated with HDL-C [0.19 (95\%  CI 0.07, 0.31)], while the associations between LDL-C [0.19 (95\% CI -0.27,  0.65)], TG [- 1.00 (95\% CI -2.09, 0.07) and telomere length were not detected. By  nonlinearity test, only the relationship between HDL-C and telomere length was  nonlinear. The inflection point we got was 1.25. On the left side of the  inflection point (telomere length ≤ 1.25), a difference in 0.1 of telomere length  was associated with 0.50 difference in HDL-C. CONCLUSION: After adjusting for  demographic data, dietary data, physical examination data, and comorbidities,  telomere length is not associated with LDL-C and TG, but is positively associated  with HDL-C when telomere length is less than 1.25.},

Telomeres, genetic  structures regulating cell growth and senescence, are one pathway through which  the exposome may impact health. Greenspace exposure, representing the amount of  green areas in one's neighborhood, is one component of the exposome and has been  associated with multiple health benefits. To investigate the potential link  between greenspace exposure and telomere length, we analyzed data from the  1999-2001 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sample. Our  study examined individual, risk, and contextual factors. We found that greater  greenspace exposure in one's neighborhood was associated with longer telomere  lengths when considering individual and risk factors, suggesting a positive  effect of living in greener neighborhoods. However, this relationship became  non-significant when contextual factors, such as air pollution and deprivation,  were included in the analysis. These findings highlight a complex relationship  between greenspace and telomere length, warranting further research to explore  contextual factors in detail.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Telomere shortening is associated with age and risk of medical comorbidity. We assessed the relationship between measures of adiposity,  leukocyte telomere length, and mortality and whether it is modified by age.  SUBJECTS/METHODS: Subjects with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measures were  identified using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002.  Obesity was categorized using two body fat definitions (BF1\%: men ⩾25\%; females  ⩾35\%; BF2\% ⩾28\% and ⩾38\%, respectively), body mass index (BMI) and waist  circumference (WC; men ⩾102 cm; females ⩾88 cm). Telomere length relative to  standard reference DNA (T/S ratio) was assessed using quantitative PCR. Weighted  multivariable regression models evaluated the association of telomere length with  adiposity, both continuously and categorically (low/normal BF\%, low/high WC and  standard BMI categories). Differences in telomere length by age and adiposity  were ascertained and subsequent models were stratified by age. Proportional  hazard models assessed the risk of mortality by adiposity status. A telomere by  adiposity interaction was tested in the entire cohort and by age category ({\textless}60 vs  ⩾60 years; {\textless}70 vs ⩾70 years). RESULTS: We identified 7827 subjects. Mean age was  46.1 years. Overall telomere length was 1.05±0.01 (s.e.) that differed by BF1\%  (low/high: 1.12±0.02 vs 1.03±0.02; P{\textless}0.001), BF2\% (1.02±0.02 vs 1.11±0.02;  P{\textless}0.001), BMI (underweight 1.08±0.03; normal 1.09±0.02; overweight 1.04±0.02; and  obese 1.03±0.02;P{\textless}0.001) and WC (low/high 1.09±0.02 vs 1.02±0.02; P{\textless}0.001).  Adjusted β-coefficients evaluating the relationship between telomere length and  adiposity (measured continuously) were as follows: BF1\% (β=-0.0033±0.0008;  P{\textless}0.001), BF2\% (-0.041±0.008; P{\textless}0.001), BMI (β=-0.025±0.0008; P=0.005) and WC  (β=-0.0011±0.0004; P=0.007). High BF\% (BF1\%: β=-0.035±0.011; P=0.002; BF2\%:  β=-0.041±0.008; P{\textless}0.001) and WC (β=-0.035±0.011; P=0.008) were inversely related  to telomere length (TL). Stratifying by age, high BF1\% (-0.061±0.013), BF2\%  (-0.065±0.01), BMI-obesity (-0.07±0.015) and high WC (-0.048±0.013) were  significant (all P{\textless}0.001). This association diminished with increasing age. In  older participants, TL was inversely related to mortality (hazard ratio 0.36  (0.27, 0.49)), as were those classified by BF1\% (0.68 (0.56, 0.81)), BF2\% (0.75  (0.65, 0.80)), BMI (0.50 (0.42, 0.60)) and WC (0.72 (0.63, 0.83)). No interaction  was observed between adiposity status, telomere length and mortality.  CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with shorter telomere length in young  participants, a relationship that diminishes with increasing age. It does not  moderate the relationship with mortality.},

The investigation  was cross-sectional and data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES). LTL was measured by the quantitative polymerase  chain reaction method. Walking minutes was calculated from walking frequency and  duration measures. Results showed that for each year of chronological age,  telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter (P {\textless} 0.0001). With walking minutes and LTL  treated as continuous variables, the relationship was quadratic, not linear  (F = 11.2, P = 0.0023). With walking time divided into three categories, adults  who performed ≥ 150 minutes of walking per week had longer telomeres than those  who did no regular walking, and those who did some, but less than the  recommendation (F = 5.0, P = 0.0137). Regular walkers were estimated to have a  biologic ageing advantage associated with 6.5-7.6 years less biologic ageing  compared to non-walkers, after adjusting for covariates.

The dietary inflammatory index (DII) is strongly  associated with various chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to  investigate the association between DII and biological aging in US adults using  quantitative indicators. METHODS: Based on data from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018, weighted multiple linear  regression models, generalized weighted models, and smoothed fitted curves were  used to investigate the linear and nonlinear relationships of DII with four  biological markers of aging (biological age, phenotypic age, telomere length, and  serum klotho concentration). RESULTS: A total of 35,575 adult participants with  complete data were included in the study. After adjusting for all confounders,  significant positive correlations were found between DII with biological age  [0.070 (0.045, 0.095)] and phenotypic age [0.421 (0.371, 0.471)], with an  increase of 0.07 and 0.42 years in biological age and phenotypic age,  respectively, for each increase in DII score. The negative correlations between  DII with telomere length [ - 0.005 ( - 0.008, - 0.002)] and klotho [ - 3.874  ( - 7.409, - 0.338)] were significant only in partially adjusted models and  differed across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, higher DII scores  (greater pro-inflammatory dietary potential) were associated with biological  aging.

This study aimed to investigate the potential association between  LTL and all-cause mortality as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in  middle-aged or older individuals without a history of CVD. METHODS: A total of  4174 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2002 were included in this analysis. Cox  proportional hazards regression models were utilized to estimate the association  between LTL and mortality outcomes. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were  employed to evaluate the potential non-linear association. RESULTS: Over a median  follow-up period of 217 months, the weighted rates of all-cause mortality and CVD  mortality were 28.58\% and 8.32\% respectively. Participants in the highest LTL  group exhibited a significantly decreased risk of both all-cause mortality (HR:  0.65, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.78, P {\textless} 0.001) and CVD mortality (HR: 0.64, 95\% CI:  0.45-0.93, P {\textless} 0.001) compared to those in the lowest group. Kaplan-Meier  survival curves further supported a significant association between shorter  telomere length and increased risks of both all-cause and CVD mortality (log-rank  test P {\textless} 0.001). RCS curves demonstrated a linear dose-response relationship  between LTL and all-cause mortality as well as CVD mortality. Subgroup and  sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: Shorter  leukocyte telomere length could serve as a potential biomarker for risk  stratification of all-cause and CVD mortality among middle-aged and older  individuals without a history of CVD.},

DESIGN: Secondary population-based study. SETTING: The  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2001-2002).  PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1694 male participants were extracted from the NHANES  database for 2001-2002. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary focus  of the study was to determine the association between the LTL and ED, using  multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models for  examination. The secondary outcome measures involved conducting stratified  subgroup analyses to exclude interactions of different variables with the LTL.  RESULTS: Participants with ED had shorter LTLs than those without ED (p{\textless}0.05).  After adjusting for confounding factors, compared with the reference lowest LTL  quartile, the ORs and 95\% CIs for the second, third and fourth LTL quartiles were  (OR 1.51; 95\% CI 1.01 to 2.26), (OR 1.79; 95\% CI 1.24 to 2.58) and (OR 1.25;  95\% CI 0.74 to 2.11), respectively. In addition, restricted cubic splines showed  an inverted J-curve relationship between the LTL and ED. At an LTL of 1.037, the  curve showed an inflection point.

We used  multivariate linear regression and restricted cubic splines to assess the  relationship between dietary vitamin K intake and TL. Subgroup analyses and  interaction tests were utilized to examine the stability of the results.

Individuals with the highest dietary vitamin K intake had  significantly longer TL (β = 80.27, 95\% CI: 20.83-139.71, P = .008). Subgroup  analyses suggested that this association persisted in populations stratified by  gender, age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), body mass index and total  energy intake (P for interaction {\textgreater} .05).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass or function with aging and is associated with adverse outcomes. Telomere shortening  is associated with mortality, yet its relationship with sarcopenia is unknown.  SUBJECTS/METHODS: Adults ≥60 years from the 1999-2002 NHANES with body  composition measures were identified. Sarcopenia was defined using the two  Foundation for the National Institute of Health definitions: appendicular lean  mass (ALM) (men {\textless}19.75; women {\textless}15.02 kg); or ALM divided by body mass index (BMI)  (ALM:BMI, men {\textless}0.789; women {\textless}0.512). Telomere length was assessed using  quantitative PCR. Regression models predicted telomere length with sarcopenia  (referent = no sarcopenia). RESULTS: We identified 2672 subjects. Mean age was  70.9 years (55.5\% female). Prevalence of ALM and ALM:BMI sarcopenia was 29.2 and  22.1\%. Deaths were higher in persons with sarcopenia as compared to those without  sarcopenia (ALM: 46.4 vs. 33.4\%, p {\textless} 0.001; ALM:BMI: 46.7 vs. 33.2\%, p {\textless} 0.001).  No adjusted differences were observed in telomere length in those with/without  sarcopenia (ALM: 0.90 vs. 0.92, p = 0.74, ALM:BMI 0.89 vs. 0.92, p = 0.24). In  men with ALM:BMI-defined sarcopenia, adjusted telomere length was significantly  lower compared to men without sarcopenia (0.85 vs. 0.91, p = 0.013). With  sarcopenia, we did not observe a significant association between telomere length  and mortality (ALM: HR 1.11 [0.64,1.82], p = 0.68; ALM:BMI: HR 0.97 [0.53,1.77],  p = 0.91), but noted significance in those without sarcopenia with mortality  (ALM: HR 0.59 [0.40,0.86], p = 0.007; ALM:BMI: HR 0.62 [0.42,0.91]; p = 0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: We observed a potentially inverse relationship between telomere  length and mortality in those without sarcopenia but did not observe a  significant relationship between telomere length and mortality in the presence of  sarcopenia.},

	abstract = {Background: Multilevel frameworks suggest neighborhood circumstances influence biology; however, this relationship is not well studied. Telomere length (TL)  shortening has been associated with individual-level and neighborhood-level  exposures and disease and may provide insights into underlying biologic  mechanisms linking neighborhood with biology. To support neighborhood-biology  investigations, we sought to determine the independent effect of neighborhood  exposures on TL using standard multilevel linear regression models and quantile  regression, a nonlinear, social science method applicable for testing the  biologic hypothesis that extremes of the TL distribution are related to poor  outcomes.Methods: In a multicenter, cross-sectional study, blood TL was measured  in 1,488 individuals from 127 census tracts in three U.S. regions using terminal  restriction fragment assays. Multilevel linear and quantile regression models  were adjusted for individual-level race, education, perceived stress, and  depression. Neighborhood exposures included population density, urban/residential  crowding, residential stability/mobility, and socioeconomic status.Results: TL  was not associated with any neighborhood variable using linear models, but  quantile regression revealed inverse associations between population density and  urban crowding at the lower tails of the TL distribution [5th (population density  P = 0.03; urban crowding P = 0.002), 50th (both P {\textless} 0.001), 75th percentiles  (both P {\textless} 0.001)]. TL was related to residential stability at the upper tail  (95th percentile P = 0.006).Conclusions: Findings support the use of nonlinear  statistical methods in TL research and suggest that neighborhood exposures can  result in biological effects.Impact: TL may serve as an underlying example of a  biologic mechanism that can link neighborhood with biology, thus supporting  multilevel investigations in future studies.

Latent Class Analysis identified three phthalate metabolites exposure patterns:  high MEP-low MEOHP (n = 282), high MBzP-low MEHHP (n = 214), and high MEHHP,  MEOHP (n = 149). The high MBzP-low MEHHP and high MEHHP, MEOHP, versus the high  MEP-low MEOHP, exposure groups showed significantly higher levels of fasting  insulin (β = 0.126, 95\% CI: 0.023-0.228), SPISE (β = 0.091, 95\% CI: 0.018-0.164),  and HOMA-IR (β = 0.091, 95\% CI: 0.018-0.164). In the shorter telomere length  group, high MEHHP, MEOHP exposure showed an increase in SPISE levels (β = 0.153,  95\% CI: 0.037-0.269), while in the overweight/obese subgroup, high MEHHP, MEOHP  exposure was significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR (β = 0.392, 95\% CI:  0.150-0.735). Bayesian kernel machine regression analyses showed positive  associations between higher combined phthalate exposure and increased glucose  homeostasis indices (fasting glucose, HbA(1C), fasting insulin, SPISE, and  HOMA-IR). The quantile of g-calculation analysis also supported the positive  associations with HbA(1C), HOMA-IR, and fasting insulin. Our findings indicate  that phthalate exposure was positively associated with glucose homeostasis  indices, which strengthen the call for proactive measures to reduce phthalate  exposure and mitigate potential risks to glucose metabolism.},

The goal of this analysis was to investigate whether there  is an association between antimony exposure and leukocyte telomere length (LTL)  among US adults aged 20 and older based on the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. We used multivariate linear regression to  analyze the association of urinary antimony with LTL.

After adjustment for potential confounders, individuals in the 3rd  and 4th quartiles of urinary antimony had statistically significantly shorter LTL  (-4.78\%, 95\% CI: -8.42,-0.90; and -6.11\%, 95\% CI: -11.04,-1.00, respectively)  compared to the lowest referent quartile, with evidence of a dose-response  relationship (p-value for trend =0.03). Shorter LTL with antimony was driven by  middle aged (40-59 years) and older (60-85 years) adult groups. The association  may be biologically plausible because of reported oxidative stress and apoptosis  effects of antimony on blood cells, effects known to shorten telomere length.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We  analyzed NHANES 2017-2020 data to calculate phenotypic age. Hepatic steatosis and  fibrosis were identified using controlled attenuation parameters (CAP), fatty  liver index (FLI) and transient elastography (TE). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95 \%  confidence intervals (CI) for significant MASLD fibrosis were calculated using  multivariate logistic regression, and subgroup analyses were performed. We  explored the potential causal relationship between telomere length and liver  fibrosis using Mendelian randomization (MR). Additionally, we used the expression  quantitative trait loci (eQTL) method and GSE197112 data to identify genes  related to liver fibrosis and senescence. Finally, the APOLD1 expression was  validated using GSE89632. RESULTS: Phenotypic age was associated with liver  fibrosis occurrence in MASLD (OR = 1.08, 95 \% CI 1.05-1.12). Subgroup analyses by  BMI and age revealed differences. For obese or young to middle-aged MASLD  patients, phenotypic age is significantly associated with liver fibrosis. (OR =  1.14, 95 \% CI 1.10-1.18; OR = 1.07, 95 \% CI 1.01-1.14 and OR = 1.14, 95 \% CI  1.07-1.22). MR revealed a negative association between telomere length and liver  fibrosis (IVW method: OR = 0.63288, 95 \% CI 0.42498-0.94249). The gene APOLD1 was  identified as a potential target through the intersection of the GEO dataset and  eQTL genes. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasized the link between biological aging  and fibrosis in young to middle-aged obese MASLD patients. We introduced  phenotypic age as a clinical indicator and identified APOLD1 as a potential  therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, telomere length is known to reflect the replication potential and longevity of cells, and many studies have reported that telomere  length is associated with age-related diseases and biological aging. Studies have  also shown that vitamin C acts as an oxidant and free radical scavenger to  protect cells from oxidative stress and telomere wear, thus achieving anti-aging  effects. At present, there are few and incomplete studies on the relationship  between vitamin C and telomere length, so this study aims to explore the  relationship between vitamin C and telomere length. METHODS: This study used  cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys  (NHANES) database from 1999 to 2002, a total of 7,094 participants were selected  from all races in the United States. Male participants accounted for 48.2\% and  female participants accounted for 51.8\%. The correlation between vitamin C and  telomere length was assessed using a multiple linear regression model, and the  effect of dietary vitamin C on telomere length was obtained after adjusting for  confounding factors such as age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and poverty  income ratio (PIR). RESULTS: This cross-sectional study showed that vitamin C was  positively correlated with telomere length, with greater dietary vitamin C intake  associated with longer telomeres (β = 0.03, 95\% CI: 0.01-0.05, P = 0.003).  CONCLUSION: This study shows that vitamin C intake is positively correlated with  human telomere length, which is of guiding significance for our clinical guidance  on people's health care, but our study need to be confirmed by more in-depth and  comprehensive other research results.},

	abstract = {Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. While its etiology is largely  unknown, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation plays a major role. Our  objective was to investigate the association between peripheral blood leukocyte  telomere length (LTL) and endometriosis using data from two large  population-based studies, the New England Case-Control Study (NEC; n = 877) and  the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 2268). NEC  control participants were identified through a combination of random digit  dialing, drivers' license lists, and town resident lists. In NHANES, selection  algorithms were used to identify a nationally representative sample. Blood  samples and demographic, reproductive, and health-related information were  available from both data sources. Endometriosis was defined as self-reported of  physician-diagnosed endometriosis. LTL was measured using quantitative polymerase  chain reaction. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds  ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between LTL and  endometriosis. Shorter LTL was associated with greater odds of history of  endometriosis. In NEC, women with the shortest LTL tertile compared with the  longest had a 2.5-fold greater odds of endometriosis (OR(T3/T1) = 2.56, 95\%  CI = 1.16-5.63; p value, test for linear trend = 0.02). The association was  stronger among women who usually experienced moderate or severe menstrual pain  (OR (T3/T1) = 3.50, 95\% CI = 1.12-10.97). In NHANES, the data suggested a similar  but attenuated association (OR(T3/T1) = 1.29, 95\% CI = 0.85-1.96). The observed  associations in NEC suggest that shorter LTL may be associated with greater odds  of endometriosis. A better understanding of how LTL influences endometriosis risk  could elucidate novel disease pathophysiology.},

METHODS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. Cadmium exposure level was assessed by  measuring cadmium levels in blood samples. Leukocyte telomere length was measured  by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and cognitive function was measured by  the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). RESULTS: A total of 2185 older adults  aged over 60 were included in this study, comprising 1109 (49.65\%) males.  Elevated blood cadmium levels were significantly associated with the risk of a  decline in cognitive function (β = - 2.842, p = 0.018). Shorter leukocyte  telomere lengths were significantly associated with a higher risk of a decline in  cognitive function (β = 4.144, p = 0.020). The total indirect effect on the blood  cadmium level and cognitive function via leukocyte telomere length was - 0.218  (p = 0.012). The mediation effect was estimated to be  0.218/2.084 × 100\% = 10.46\%.

The objective of this study is to explore the  potential association between LTL and ED. METHODS: We utilized data from the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine the  association between LTL and ED. Weighted multivariate regression analyses were  performed as the primary statistical method. Subgroup analyses were conducted to  investigate specific population subsets, and restricted cubic spline (RCS)  analyses were employed to assess the non-linear relationship between LTL and ED.  RESULTS: The results of weighted multivariate regression analyses revealed a  negative correlation between LTL and the risk of ED. Individuals with ED  exhibited shorter LTL compared to those without ED. For each unit increase in  LTL, there was a 54\% reduction in the risk of ED (odds ratios[OR] 0.46, 95\%  confidence intervals[CI] 0.25-0.85). When LTL was considered as a categorical  variable, the group with the longest LTL (Q5) had a 44\% lower risk of ED compared  to the group with the shortest LTL(Q1) (OR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.39-0.81). A non-linear  relationship was observed between TL and ED. Various sensitivity analyses were  conducted to validate the stability of the results, and consistent findings were  obtained.

Urine metal also might accelerate the  development of aging related disease. We aimed to analyze the association between  LTL and urinary metals. METHODS: In this research, we screened all cycles of  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, and download  the eligible dataset in NHANES 1999-2002 containing demographic, disease history,  eight urine metal, and LTL. The analysis in this research had three steps  including baseline difference comparison, multiple linear regression (MLR) for  hazardous urine metals, and artificial neural network (ANN, based on Tensorflow  framework) to make LTL prediction. RESULTS: The MLR results showed that urinary  cadmium (Cd) was negatively correlated with LTL in the USA population [third  quantile: -9.36, 95\% confidential interval (CI) = (-19.7, -2.32)], and in the  elderly urinary molybdenum (Mo) was positively associated with LTL [third  quantile: 24.37, 95\%CI = (5.42, 63.55)]. An ANN model was constructed, which had  24 neurons, 0.375 exit rate in the first layer, 15 neurons with 0.53 exit rate in  the second layer, and 7 neurons with 0.86 exit rate in the third layer. The  squared error loss (LOSS) and mean absolute error (MAE) in the ANN model were  0.054 and 0.181, respectively, which showed a low error rate. CONCLUSION: In  conclusion, in adults especially the elderly, the relationships between urinary  Cd and Mo might be worthy of further research. An accurate prediction model based  on ANN could be further analyzed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examines the association of periodontitis with telomere length (TL) and effect modification by population characteristics. METHODS: We  analyzed data from 3,478 participants from the 1999 to 2002 National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey. Probing depth, attachment loss, and bleed on  probing (BOP, available for 1,973 participants only) were examined on the distal,  mesial, or mid-facial site of each tooth in two randomly selected quadrants. We  defined periodontitis severity according to the Centers for Disease  Control/American Academy of Periodontology guideline. TL from leukocytes was  measured with qPCR. We used linear and logistic regression to examine the  adjusted association of different severity of periodontitis and BOP with  continuous TL (bp) and dichotomized short TL ({\textless}median), respectively. To assess  effect modification, we stratified the analyses by a priori selected population  characteristics including sex, age, body weight status, smoking, and  cardiometabolic comorbidity. RESULTS: Moderate BOP ({\textless}10\% bleeding sites) was  significantly associated with a shorter continuous TL (β = -89.0, SE = 37.8).  Moderate to severe periodontitis was significantly associated with 47\% (95\%  confidence interval [IL], 1.04 to 2.09) higher odds of shorter TL, compared with  those with mild or no periodontitis. The association was stronger in those who  were female (adjusted OR, 1.76; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 2.83), overweight or obese  (adjusted OR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.12 to 2.41), or had cardiometabolic comorbidities  (adjusted OR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.38 to 3.29). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis was  associated with TL, a biomarker of cellular aging. The association was stronger  in females, overweight or obese, or those with cardiometabolic diseases.  Treatment on periodontitis could potentially protect individuals from  aging-related diseases.},

The c-myc  up-regulates the telomerase reverse transcriptase which adds the telomeres  repeating sequences to the chromosomal ends to compensate for the progressive  loss of telomeric sequence. We performed multivariate linear regression to  analyze the association of PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and  1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran with leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in the  adult population (n = 2413) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey 1999-2002. LTL was natural log-transformed and the results were  re-transformed and presented as percent differences. Individuals in the 3rd and  4th quartiles of the sum of PCBs were associated with 8.33\% (95\% CI: 4.08-13.88)  and 11.63\% (95\% CI: 6.18-17.35) longer LTLs, respectively, compared with the  lowest quartile, with evidence of a dose-response relationship (p-trend {\textless} 0.01).  The association of the sum PCBs with longer LTL was found in both sexes.  Additionally, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran and  1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin were associated with longer LTL. The age  independent association between longer LTL and environmental exposures to PCBs,  1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  may support a role as tumor promoter of these compounds. Further studies to  evaluate the effect of these compounds on LTL are needed to more fully understand  the implications of our finding.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Previous studies have shown that plant-rich dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, are associated with longer telomeres. However, no  association has been found between vegetarian diet and telomere length. We  hypothesized that the quality of plant-based diets plays an important role in  telomere length. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. Diet was assessed using a 24-h recall  method. Plant-based diet quality was assessed using the overall plant-based diet  index (PDI), healthy PDI (hPDI), and unhealthy PDI (uPDI). Telomere length was  measured using quantitative PCR. Linear and ordinal logistic regression models  were used to assess the association of PDIs with log-transformed telomere length  and ordinal quintiles of telomere length in descending order, respectively.  RESULTS: In both regression models, the overall PDI was not associated with  telomere length. The hPDI was associated with longer telomere length [percentage  change = 2.34\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.42\%, 4.31\%, P(trend) = 0.016;  odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.69, 0.95, P(trend) = 0.013]. However, uPDI was  associated with shorter telomere length (percentage change = -3.17\%, 95\%  CI: -5.65\%, -0.62\%, P(trend) = 0.017; OR = 1.25, 95\% CI:1.03, 1.53,  P(trend) = 0.014) and this inverse association was stronger in the non-Hispanic  white population (P(interaction) = 0.001 in both regression models). CONCLUSIONS:  A plant-based dietary pattern rich in healthy plant foods is associated with  longer telomeres. However, plant-based dietary patterns rich in unhealthy  plant-based foods are associated with shorter telomere lengths, especially in  non-Hispanic white populations.},

METHODS: Among 3,472 participants from the National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycle 1999-2000, LTL was  measured with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction. H pylori IgG was  measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and defined as seropositivity with  an immune status ratio score {\textgreater} 0.9. We used linear regression models to examine  the relation of H pylori IgG seropositivity with continuous LTL and logistic  regression for the relation with short LTL ({\textless}10th percentile of the population  distribution) adjusting for potential confounders. We stratified the analyses by  a priori selected variables. RESULTS: Population prevalence of H pylori IgG  seropositivity was 31.5\% in the overall population with higher prevalence found  in those with older age, other races than non-Hispanic whites, lower education,  and being born out of the United States. Continuous LTL was non-significantly  shorter in those with H Pylori IgG seropositivity versus seronegativity (mean  difference = -40.3 bp, 95\% CI: -112.4, 31.9). This difference was not significant  after adjusting for potential confounders nor stratifying by potential effect  modifiers. H Pylori IgG seropositivity was significantly associated with short  LTL among the elderly (55-75 years, adjusted OR: 3.06, 95\% CI: 1.17, 7.99), but  not in the overall population (OR: 1.28, 95\% CI: 0.81-2.02).

Monocyte to high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) is a novel indicator of inflammation,  oxidative stress, and metabolic syndrome, with some predictive ability for  related disease risks in clinical practice. However, there is no research on the  correlation between these two factors. METHODS: Using data from the National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2002, we conducted  analysis and research on the correlation between MHR and telomere length using  the Kruskal-Wallis H test, Spearman rank correlation analysis, and partial  correlation analysis. Weighted linear regression analysis assessed the strength  of the association between the two variables, while restricted cubic spline  regression (RCS) explored potential nonlinear relationships between them.  RESULTS: The results of correlation analysis showed that MHR levels were  negatively correlated with telomere length (ρ=-0.083, P {\textless} 0.001), and this  relationship remained statistically significant after controlling for other  covariates (P all {\textless} 0.001). Weighted linear regression analysis showed that after  adjusting for all covariates, MHR remained negatively associated with telomere  length (β = -0.020; 95\% CI: -0.039 to -0.002; P = 0.037). Subgroup analysis shows  that the negative association between MHR and telomere length appeared more  striking among females (𝛽 = -0.024; 95\%CI: -0.050 to 0.001; P = 0.058), the  Non-Hispanic White (𝛽 = -0.022; 95\%CI: -0.045 to 0.002; P = 0.066), and other  race (𝛽 = -0.067; 95\%CI: -0.134 to -0.000; P = 0.049). Using RCS explored  potential nonlinear relationships between MHR and telomere length, revealing no  nonlinear relationship between the two (P = 0.102). CONCLUSIONS: This study  suggests a negative correlation between MHR levels and telomere length in  American adults. More comprehensive research is needed to confirm these findings  in the future.},

Another purpose was to assess the extent to which  multiple demographic and lifestyle covariates affect the relationship between PA  and LTL. A total of 5823 adults from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2002) were studied cross-sectionally. Employing  the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method, LTL was compared to standard  reference DNA. PA was indexed using MET-minutes using self-reported frequency,  intensity, and duration of participation in 62 physical activities. Covariates  were controlled statistically. Telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter for each  year of chronological age (F=723.2, P{\textless}0.0001). PA was inversely related to LTL  after adjusting for all the covariates (F=8.3, P=0.0004). Telomere base pair  differences between adults with High activity and those in the Sedentary, Low,  and Moderate groups were 140, 137, and 111, respectively. Adults with High  activity were estimated to have a biologic aging advantage of 9years (140 base  pairs÷15.6) over Sedentary adults. The difference in cell aging between those  with High and Low activity was also significant, 8.8years, as was the difference  between those with High and Moderate PA (7.1years). Overall, PA was significantly  and meaningfully associated with telomere length in U.S. men and women.  Evidently, adults who participate in high levels of PA tend to have longer  telomeres, accounting for years of reduced cellular aging compared to their more  sedentary counterparts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telomere length, which is related to chronic diseases and premature mortality, is influenced by dietary factors. Zinc is known as a dietary  antioxidant micronutrient, however, its impact on telomere length remains  unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential effect of dietary zinc  intake on telomere length among middle-aged and older individuals in the US.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 3,793 US participants aged 45 years and  older from the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  (NHANES). 24-h dietary recall interviews were employed to evaluate zinc  consumption. Leukocyte telomere length was assessed by real-time quantitative  polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We adopted generalized linear models to  investigate the effect of dietary zinc intake on telomere length, and subgroup  analyses were further applied. We further evaluated the dose-response  relationship using restricted cubic spline analysis. RESULTS: Among the 3,793  participants, the average telomere length was 0.926 ± 0.205 (T/S ratio) or 5509.5  ± 494.9 (bp). After adjusting for major confounders, every 5 mg increment in  dietary zinc consumption was related to 0.64\% (95\% CI: 0.17\%, 1.10\%) longer  telomere length. In the subgroup analyses, significant relationships were found  in females (Percentage change: 1.11\%; 95\% CI: 0.48\%, 1.75\%), obese (Percentage  change: 0.88\%; 95\% CI: 0.26\%, 1.50\%), and low energy intake individuals  (Percentage change: 0.99\%; 95\% CI: 0.51\%, 1.46\%). Additionally, we revealed a  positive linear relationship between dietary zinc intake and telomere length (P  for non-linearity = 0.636). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that elevated dietary  zinc intake was significantly related to longer telomere length among adults aged  45 years and older in the US.

This study aims to  investigate the associations between LTL and all-cause and cause-specific  mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: All participants with  baseline LTL records were included from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey 1999-2002. Death status and its causes were ascertained for  National Death Index based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth  Revision code. Cox proportional hazards regression models were established to  estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of LTL associating with all-cause and  cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: The study enrolled 804 diabetic patients with  the mean follow-up of 14.9 ± 2.59 years. There were 367 (45.6\%) all-cause deaths,  80 (10.0\%) cardiovascular deaths, and 42 (5.2\%) cancer-related deaths. Longer LTL  was associated with reduced all-cause mortality, whereas this association  disappeared after adjusting for other variables. Compared with the lowest  tertiles of LTL, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of cardiovascular  mortality was 2.11 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-3.39; p {\textless} .05) in the  highest tertiles. In terms of cancer mortality, the highest tertile was  negatively correlated with the risk of cancer mortality (HR 0.58 [95\% CI 0.37,  0.91], p {\textless} .05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, LTL was independently associated with  the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and was  negatively correlated with the risk of cancer mortality.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More indications proved that diet might be involved in the telomere length, a marker of biological aging and chronic diseases. Copper is widely  viewed as one of the essential elements in the diet. Therefore, this study aimed  to evaluate the relationship between telomere length and dietary copper intake in  hypertension and provide a basis for guiding dietary copper intake in patients  with hypertension. METHODS: The data was collected from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. The relevance  between telomere length and dietary copper intake in hypertension is assessed  using a multivariable linear regression model. RESULTS: We gathered 1,867  participants with hypertension with assessed telomere length and dietary copper  intake. We found that one unit increasing log-transformed dietary copper intake  in hypertension was significantly associated with longer telomere length base  pair (bp) (β = 112.20, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 5.48, 218.92), after  controlling for covariates, including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI),  physical activity, and taking medication for hypertension. For the age group, we  found that one unit increasing log-transformed dietary copper in hypertension was  associated with longer telomere length (β = 237.95, 95\% CI: 114.39, 361.51) in  the age group {\textgreater}45 years. The grouping was based on whether the participants take  medication for hypertension. We found that one unit increasing log-transformed  dietary copper in hypertension was associated with longer telomere length (β =  116.47, 95\% CI: 0.72, 232.21) in the group that takes medication for  hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that dietary copper intake was  associated with longer telomere length in patients with hypertension, which  provides evidence for guiding dietary copper intake in patients with  hypertension. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of  copper supplementation on telomere length in patients with hypertension in  well-designed random control studies and prospective studies.},

This  study examined the hypothesis that differential telomere shortening, a measure of  cellular aging, by race/ethnicity may explain prior findings of differential CVD  risk in racial/ethnic groups with military service. Data from the first two  continuous waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  (NHANES), administered from 1999-2002 were analyzed. Mean telomere length in base  pairs was analyzed with multivariable adjusted linear regression with complex  sample design, stratified by sex. The unadjusted mean telomere length was 225.8  base shorter for individuals with prior military service. The mean telomere  length for men was 47.2 (95\% CI: -92.9, -1.5; p {\textless} 0.05) base pairs shorter for  men with military service after adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and  behavioral variables, but did not differ significantly in women with and without  prior military service. The interaction between military service and  race/ethnicity was not significant for men or women. The results suggest that  military service may contribute to accelerated aging as a result of health  damaging exposures, such as combat, injury, and environmental contaminants,  though other unmeasured confounders could also potentially explain the results.},

Adults at the 75th percentile of gamma-tocopherol had 2.8-3.4 years greater  cellular aging than those at the 25th percentile, depending on the covariates in  the model. However, alpha-tocopherol was not related to telomere length.  Evidently, gamma-tocopherol levels, but not alpha-tocopherol, account for  meaningful increases in biological aging.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous research has shown a significant association between weight and telomere length, but did not take into consideration weight range. The study  was to investigate the association of weight range with telomere length. METHODS:  Data of 2918 eligible participants aged 25-84 years from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000 cycle were analyzed. Information  about demographic variables, lifestyle factors, anthropometric variables, and  medical comorbidities were included. Univariate and multivariate linear  regression model with adjustments for potential confounders were employed to  determine the association between weight range and telomere length. A  non-parametrically restricted cubic spline model was used to illustrate the  possible non-linear relationship. RESULTS: In univariate linear regression,  BMI(max), BMI range, and weight range all revealed significant negative  associations with telomere length. However, annual rate of BMI/weight range  showed a significant positive associations with telomere length. There was no  significant association between telomere length and BMI(min). After adjusting for  potential confounders, the inverse associations persisted in BMI(max) (β=-0.003,  P{\textless}0.001), BMI range (β=-0.002, P=0.003), and weight range (β=-0.001, P=0.001).  Furthermore, annual rate of BMI range (β=-0.026, P=0.009) and weight range  (β=-0.010, P=0.007) presented negative associations with telomere length, after  adjusting for covariates in Model 2-4. The association between BMI(min) (β  =-0.002, P=0.237) and telomere length still could not reach statistical  significance in multivariate linear regression model. The results of restricted  cubic spline analysis showed that BMI(max) (P for nonlinear =0.026), BMI range (P  for nonlinear =0.022), weight range (P for nonlinear =0.035), annual rate of BMI  range (P for nonlinear =0.030), and annual rate of weight range (P for nonlinear  =0.027) all had nonlinear inverse associations with telomere length. CONCLUSIONS:  The study suggests that weight range is inversely associated with telomere length  in U.S. adults. Larger weight fluctuation may accelerate telomere shortening and  aging.},

Another purpose  was to test the impact of potential confounders on the association. Fiber  consumption was measured using a 24 h recall and telomere length was indexed  using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Overall, the U.S. adults  had low fiber intake (median: 6.6 g per 1000 kcal)-less than one-half the  recommendation of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. With age, gender, race,  housing status, and misreported energy intake controlled, the relationship  between fiber intake per 1000 kcal and telomere length was linear (F = 9.5, p =  0.0045). Specifically, for each 1 g increment in fiber intake per 1000 kcal,  telomeres were 8.3 base pairs longer. Because each additional year of  chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 15.5 base pairs  shorter, results suggest that a 10 g increase in fiber intake per 1000 kcal would  correspond with telomeres that are 83 base pairs longer. On average, this would  equate to 5.4 fewer years of biologic aging (83 ÷ 15.5). With smoking, BMI,  alcohol use, and physical activity controlled, as well as the other covariates,  each 10 g increment in fiber accounted for telomeres that were 67 base pairs  longer (F = 7.6, p = 0.0101), a biologic aging difference of about 4.3 years. In  conclusion, significant fiber consumption accounts for longer telomeres and less  biologic aging than lower levels of fiber intake.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with shorter telomeres. The loss of muscle mass with aging is associated with adverse outcomes. The  appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI) is currently used to quantify muscle  mass. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of the ASMI with leukocyte  telomere length in adult Americans. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 dataset. Body  composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Low muscle mass was  defined using sex-specific thresholds of the appendicular skeletal muscle mass  index (ASMI). The telomere-to-single-copy gene ratio (T/S ratio) was converted to  base pairs. Generalized linear models were performed to evaluate the association  of ASMI with telomere length. RESULTS: In multivariable adjustment regression  models, higher ASMI was associated with longer telomeres in US adults (β = 70.2,  P {\textless} 0.001, P trend{\textless}0.001). In participants with preserved muscle mass, the ASMI  was related to longer telomere length (β = 75.1, P {\textless} 0.001), but not  significantly in low muscle mass participants (β = 68.7, P = 0.30). Further  subgroup analysis by a combination of age groups and muscle mass status showed  positive association with young-preserved muscle mass (β = 82.6, P {\textless} 0.001),  old-preserved muscle mass (β = 44.4, P = 0.12), young-low muscle mass (β = 135.4,  P = 0.20), and old-low muscle mass (β = 52.7, P = 0.55). Because each additional  year of chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 15.3 base pairs  shorter, on average, this would equate to 5.4 fewer years of biological aging  (82.6 ÷ 15.3) in the young-preserved muscle mass participants. CONCLUSIONS: A  higher ASMI is associated with longer telomeres. The prevention of skeletal  muscle loss has the potential to delay telomere shortening and account for less  biological aging.},

This study assessed the relationship between exposure to a mixture of  environmental chemicals and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and further examined  whether telomere length (TL) moderated these relationships. A total of 1265  adults aged {\textgreater} 20 years participated in the study. Data on multiple pollutants  (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, and metals), MetS, leukocyte  telomere length (LTL), and confounders were provided in the 2001-2002 National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The correlations between multi-pollutant  exposure, TL, and MetS in the males and females were separately assessed using  principal component analysis (PCA), logistic and extended linear regression  models, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and mediation analysis. Four  factors were generated in PCA that accounted for 76.2\% and 77.5\% of the total  environmental pollutants in males and females, respectively. The highest  quantiles of PC2 and PC4 were associated with the risk of TL shortening  (P {\textless} 0.05). We observed that the relationship between PC2, PC4, and MetS risk was  significant in the participants with median TL levels (P for trend = 0.04 for  PC2, and P for trend = 0.01 for PC4). Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed  that TL could explain 26.1\% and 17.1\% of the effects of PC2 and PC4 associated  with MetS in males, respectively. The results of BKMR model revealed that these  associations were mainly driven by 1-PYE (cPIP = 0.65) and Cd (cPIP = 0.29) in  PC2. Meanwhile, TL could explain 17.7\% of the mediation effects of PC2 associated  with MetS in the females. However, the relationships between pollutants and MetS  were sparse and inconsistent in the females. Our findings suggest that the  effects of the risk of MetS associated with mixed exposure to multiple pollutants  are mediated by TL, and this mediating effect in the males is more pronounced  than that in the females.},

METHODS: A total of 6489 U.S. adults without diabetes from NHANES 1999-2002 were  analyzed. TyG index was calculated as ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting  glucose (mg/dL)/2]. HOMA-Index was calculated as fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)  × fasting serum insulin (mU/mL)/22.5. LTL was obtained using the quantitative  polymerase chain reaction method. Multivariate linear regression analysis was  assessed to evaluate the association of TyG index HOMA-IR with LTL. We further  conducted a generalized additive model (GAM) and a fitted smoothing curve with  penalized spline method. RESULTS: It was found that the mean LTL was 5796.1 bp in  the measured healthy adults. Overall, TyG index was significantly associated with  LTL, while HOMA-IR was not. Compared with participants in tertile 1 of the TyG  index, the β (95\% CI) for those in the second (8.27 to 8.77) and third (≥ 8.77)  were -4.31 (95\% CI: -48.12{\textasciitilde}39.49) and -95.98 (95\% CI: -145.08{\textasciitilde}-46.89),  respectively.

We further explored a dose-response relation between TyG index by a decile  approach [≤ 7.81 (reference), 7.81-8.04, 8.04-8.21, 8.21-8.37, 8.37-8.52,  8.52-8.68, 8.68-8.83, 8.83-9.03, 9.03-9.33, and {\textgreater}9.33] and LTL.

METHODS: We analyzed data from 799  post-menopausal (ages 41-85) participants in the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (1999-2002), a nationally representative sample of U.S. women.  RESULTS: Controlling for behavioral, socio-demographic, and health-related  determinants of menopause, we found that among non-Hispanic white women, an  increase of one standard deviation in LTL was associated with a 0.43 year higher  reported age-at-menopause. Among Mexican-Americans, an increase of one standard  deviation in LTL was associated with a 1.56 year earlier menopause. There was no  significant association between LTL and age-at-menopause among non-Hispanic black  women. CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is evidence of a strong interaction by  race/ethnicity in the association between LTL and age-at-menopause.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by multiple potential contributing factors such as bacterial biofilm infection of the tissues  surrounding the teeth and environmental determinants and a dysregulated host  response for modifying and resolving the inflammation. Because periodontal  disease is a major public health concern with substantial increases in the  prevalence and severity in aging populations, previous studies of periodontitis  tended to approach the disease as an age-associated outcome across the life span.  However, few investigations have considered that, as a chronic noncommunicable  disease, periodontitis may not simply be a disease that increases with age but  may contribute to more rapid biologic aging. OBJECTIVES: Increasing population  data supports the potential disconnect between chronological aging and biologic  aging, which would contribute to the heterogeneity of aging phenotypes within  chronologic ages across populations. Thus, our aim was to test whether  periodontal disease affects biological aging across the life span. METHODS: The  prevalence of periodontitis in the adult US population is a portion of the  assessment of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),  which has been ongoing since 1971 through 2-y cycles sampling populations across  the country. We used NHANES 2001-2002 to test the hypothesis that the  presence/severity of periodontal disease as an exposure variable would negatively  affect telomere length, a measure of biological aging, and that this relationship  is modified by factors that also affect the progression of periodontitis, such as  sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking. RESULTS: The data demonstrated a significant  impact of periodontitis on decreasing telomere lengths across the life span.  These differences were modulated by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking within  the population. CONCLUSION: The findings lay the groundwork for future studies  documenting broader effects on biological aging parameters as well as potential  intervention strategies for periodontitis in driving unhealthy aging processes.  KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease and  dysregulated host response. Shortening of telomeres is a reflection of biologic  aging. Decreased telomere lengths with periodontitis are seemingly related to  chronic infection and persistent local and systemic inflammation. These findings  suggest that periodontitis is not simply a disease of aging but may also transmit  chronic systemic signals that could affect more rapid biological aging.  Clinicians can use this outcome to recognize the role of periodontitis in driving  unhealthy aging processes in patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telomere length (TL) serves as a pivotal gauge of cellular aging, with shorter TL linked to various age-related ailments. Recently, a DNA  methylation-based TL estimator, known as DNAmTL, has emerged as a novel TL  measurement tool. Our current investigation scrutinized the correlation between  DNAmTL and the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and enduring mortality among  middle-aged and elderly individuals. METHODS: We enrolled a nationwide,  population-based cohort of subjects from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey spanning 1999 to 2002, possessing data on both DNAmTL and  quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based TL (qPCRTL). Logistic regression  models and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the  associations of DNAmTL with CVD risk and mortality, respectively. RESULTS: The  cohort comprised 2532 participants, with a weighted CVD prevalence of 19.06\%.  Notably, each one-kilobase increase in DNAmTL was linked to a 53\% diminished CVD  risk [odds ratio (OR): 0.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.95, P = 0.035].  Over a median follow-up period of 206 months, 1361 deaths were recorded (53.75\%),  with 590 (23.30\%) ascribable to CVD. Individuals with the lengthiest DNAmTL  exhibited a 36\% lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 0.64, 95\%  CI: 0.49-0.85, P = 0.002) and a 35\% decrease in CVD mortality (HR: 0.65, 95\% CI:  0.43-0.98, P = 0.044) compared to those with shortest DNAmTL. Notably, a stronger  association with age was observed for DNAmTL compared to qPCRTL (r = -0.58 vs.  r = - 0.25). Analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves suggested  superior predictive performance of DNAmTL over qPCRTL for CVD (area under curve  (AUC): 0.63 vs. 0.55, P {\textless} 0.001), all-cause (AUC: 0.74 vs. 0.62, P {\textless} 0.001), and  CVD mortality (AUC: 0.75 vs. 0.64, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Longer DNAmTL was  positively correlated with reduced CVD risk and long-term mortality in  middle-aged and elderly cohorts. Notably, DNAmTL outperformed qPCRTL as an aging  biomarker in the stratification of CVD risks and mortality.},

Results showed that there was a significant association between dietary  selenium intake and telomere length in hypertension, particularly within the  female group. In female hypertension cases, a 1 mcg increase in dietary selenium  intake corresponded to a telomere length increase of 1.19 bp, even after  adjusting for age, race, BMI, marital status, physical activity, energy intake,  and stroke history. The relationship between dietary selenium intake and telomere  length exhibited a linear pattern in female hypertension patients.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between  dietary Se intake and telomere length in patients with diabetes.

Generalised linear models were constructed to assess the relationship between  dietary Se intake and telomere length. After controlling for the confounders, 1  μg increase in dietary Se intake in female patients with diabetes, and telomere  length increased by 1·84 base pairs (β = 1·84 (95 \% CI: 0·15, 3·53)), there was a  line relationship between dietary Se intake and telomere length in female  patients with diabetes and telomere length increased with increasing dietary Se  intake within the range of 0-250 μg.

Survey-weighted multivariable linear  regression with adjustments for potential confounders was utilized. RESULTS:  3,386 individuals were finally included. People with stable obesity had a 0.130  kbp (95\% CI: 0.061-0.198, P=1.97E-04) shorter leukocyte telomere length than  those with stable normal weight (reference group) during the 10-year period,  corresponding to approximately 8.7 years of aging. Weight gain from non-obesity  to obesity shortened the leukocyte telomere length by 0.094 kbp (95\% CI:  0.012-0.177, P=0.026), while normal weight to overweight or remaining overweight  shortened the leukocyte telomere length by 0.074 kbp (95\% CI: 0.014-0.134,  P=0.016). The leukocyte telomere length has 0.003 kbp attrition on average for  every 1 kg increase in weight from a mean age of 41 years to 51 years. Further  stratified analysis showed that the associations generally varied across sex and  race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that weight changes during a  10-year period was associated with leukocyte telomere length and supports the  theory that weight gain promotes aging across adulthood.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the major health issues worldwide. Pathophysiological changes in COPD are mainly reflected  in the deterioration of lung function with aging. METHODS: Considering that  telomere length is a hallmark of biological aging, we first performed a  meta-analysis to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between  telomere length and COPD and then employed individual-level data from the  continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to  investigate whether telomere length could reflect accelerated aging in COPD and  serve as an independent predictor. A mediation study was further performed to  examine whether the association between telomeres and COPD could be mediated by  inflammation, as one of the most important etiologies and characteristics of  COPD. RESULTS: The four studies included in our meta-analysis were with high  heterogeneity (I(2) = 95.7\%, P(het) {\textless} 0.001), and the pooled relative risk for  COPD comparing the shortest tertile versus the longest tertile was 4.06 (95\%  CI = 1.38 to 11.96). Of the 6,378 subjects in the individual-level data analyses  using NHANES, 455 were diagnosed with COPD, and multivariable-adjusted logistic  regression also indicated that short telomere length was associated with COPD.  Consistently, cubic regression spline analyses showed that long telomeres  exhibited a significant association with a decreased risk of COPD. In the  subsequent mediation analyses, C-reactive protein concentration, white blood  cells count and blood neutrophil count, as inflammatory biomarkers, showed a  significant indirect effect on the relationship between telomere length and COPD.  CONCLUSION: Accelerated aging in COPD could be characterized by excessive  telomere shortening, and inflammatory response might be involved in the  underlying mechanisms of COPD pathogenesis promoted by short telomere length.  Telomere length measurement may facilitate clinical translational research and  targeted therapy of COPD.},

In the total sample, after adjusting for all the  potential covariates, mean LTL significantly differed across the three jog/run  categories (F = 4.1, p = 0.0272). Specifically, adults who met the guidelines via  jogging and/or running had significantly longer telomeres than adults who  performed no jogging/running. Adults in the middle category did not differ from  the other two categories.

However, the role of dietary selenium  intake in telomere length maintenance is rarely examined. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to  test the relationship between dietary selenium intake and telomere length among  middle-aged and older adults in America. METHODS: A total of 3194 United States  adults older than 45 years old were extracted from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. Leukocyte  telomere length was measured using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain  reaction (qPCR). Dietary selenium intake was assessed by a trained interviewer  using 24-h dietary recall method. Generalized linear models were performed to  evaluate the association of dietary selenium intake with telomere length. The  restricted cubic spline analysis was used to further explore the nonlinear  dose-response relationship between dietary selenium intake and telomere length.  RESULTS: After adjusting potential confounders, every 20 μg increase in dietary  selenium intake was associated with 0.42\% (95\% CI: 0.02\%, 0.82\%) longer telomere  length in all participants. In the subgroup analyses, dietary selenium intake was  related to longer telomere length in females (Percentage change: 0.87\%; 95\% CI:  0.26\%, 1.49\%) and non-obese participants (Percentage change: 0.53\%; 95\% CI:  0.04\%, 1.02\%), but not in males (Percentage change: 0.04\%; 95\% CI: -0.49\%, 0.57\%)  and obese participants (Percentage change: 0.21\%; 95\% CI: -0.47\%, 0.91\%). The  restricted cubic spline analysis showed a linear association between dietary  selenium intake and telomere length. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the  increased dietary selenium intake was associated with longer telomere length  among middle-aged and older adults in America.

However, previous research has mainly focused on the  association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and individual  macronutrients, while the effects of macronutrient composition on LTL remain  unclear. This cross-sectional analysis involved 4130 US adults  (44.8 ± 17.0 years; 51\% female) from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey during 1999-2002. A single 24-h dietary recall is used to  collect dietary data. The relationship between dietary macronutrient composition  and LTL is examined using three-dimensional generalized additive models. After  adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, physical activity, BMI, and  dietary quality, a three-dimensional association of macronutrient composition  with LTL (P = 0.02) is revealed. Diets lower in protein (5-10\%), higher in  carbohydrates (75\%), and lower in fat (15-20\%) are associated with the longest  LTL corresponding to 7.7 years of slower biological aging. Diets lowest in  protein (5\%) and carbohydrate (40\%), while highest in dietary fat (55\%) are  associated with the shortest LTL, corresponding to accelerated biological aging  of 4.4 years. The associations appeared magnified with higher energy intake.  These findings support a complex relationship between dietary macronutrients and  biological aging independent of diet quality.},

Riboflavin (RF) is  known as a water-soluble antioxidant vitamin, but its role in telomere length  maintenance has yet to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to  examine the relationship between dietary RF intake and telomere length in a  nationally representative sample of adults. METHODS: Using the NHANES  (1999-2002), telomere data of 4,298 participants aged ≥45 years were analyzed in  a cross-sectional manner. Leukocyte telomere length was measured using the  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Dietary RF intake was  assessed by a trained interviewer using 24-h dietary recall method.

Subgroup analyses were performed to further explore  this relationship in sex and body mass index (BMI) subgroups. RESULTS: Among the  3,788 participants included, the average telomere length was longer in females (P  = 0.014), while they had a lower average RF intake compared to males (P {\textless} 0.001).  There was a weak positive correlation between RF intake and telomere length both  when unadjusted (β = 0.011; P = 0.037) and adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity  (β = 0.013; P = 0.033). Subgroup analyses showed a positive association between  RF intake and the telomere length in female after adjusting for confounding  factors (β = 0.029; P = 0.046). In the female subgroup, there were significant  positive relationships between telomere length and RF intake in the obese group  (β = 0.086, P = 0.022).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may influence leukocyte telomere  length (LTL), a biomarker associated with chronic disease. In vitro research  suggests dioxins may bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and induce  telomerase activity, which elongates LTL. However, few epidemiologic studies have  investigated associations between POPs and LTL. OBJECTIVES: We examined the  association between 18 PCBs, 7 dioxins, and 9 furans and LTL among 1,330 U.S.  adults from NHANES 2001-2002. METHODS: We created three summed POP metrics based  on toxic equivalency factor (TEF), a potency measure including affinity for the  AhR: a) non-dioxin-like PCBs (composed of 10 non-dioxin-like PCBs; no AhR  affinity and no TEF); b) non-ortho PCBs (composed of 2 non-ortho-substituted PCBs  with high TEFs); and c) toxic equivalency (TEQ) (composed of 7 dioxins, 9 furans,  2 non-ortho-substituted PCBs, and 6 mono-ortho-substituted PCBs; weighted by  TEF). We tested the association between each metric and LTL using linear  regression, adjusting for demographics, blood cell count and distribution, and  another metric with a different TEF (i.e., non-ortho PCBs and TEQ adjusted for  non-dioxin-like PCBs; non-dioxin-like PCBs adjusted for non-ortho PCBs). RESULTS:  In adjusted models, each doubling of serum concentrations of non-ortho PCBs and  TEQ was associated with 3.74\% (95\% CI: 2.10, 5.40) and 5.29\% (95\% CI: 1.66, 9.05)  longer LTLs, respectively. Compared with the lowest quartile, the highest  quartile of exposure was associated with 9.16\% (95\% CI: 2.96, 15.73) and 7.84\%  (95\% CI: -0.53, 16.92) longer LTLs, respectively. Non-dioxin-like PCBs were not  associated with LTL. CONCLUSIONS: POPs with high TEFs and AhR affinity were  associated with longer LTL. Because many dioxin-associated cancers are also  associated with longer LTL, these results may provide insight into the mechanisms  underlying PCB- and dioxin-related carcinogenesis.

Previous studies examined association  of nutrient intake with telomere length targeting middle-aged and elderly  individuals. This study examined whether dietary macro- and micronutrient intake  was associated with telomere length in young females. METHODS: Seventy-four  Japanese young females (median (interquartile range) age was 19 (19 - 20) years)  participated. We estimated their intake of nutrients (energy, protein, fat,  carbohydrate, essential elements, vitamins, fatty acids, and dietary fibre) using  a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and measured telomere length  (T/S ratio, the ratio of telomere repeat copy number (T) to single-copy gene  number (S)) of DNA extracted from blood by qPCR. The association between telomere  length and tertiles of nutrient intake were analysed. RESULTS: The median  (interquartile range) of telomere length was 0.70 (0.52 - 0.98). Vitamin A intake  was positively associated with telomere length (tertile 1 vs. 2, coefficient [95\%  confidence interval] = 0.42 [0.12, 0.71]; tertile 1 vs. 3, coefficient [95\%  confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.04, 0.62]) after adjusting for covariates (age,  BMI, passive smoking, and drinking). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that  variation in vitamin A intake might influence telomere attrition in healthy  individuals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Telomere shortening is a well-established marker of biological aging. Whether telomere erosion coincides with age-related increases in antinuclear  antibody (ANA) seropositivity remains unknown. Our study aimed to determine the  association between ANA seropositivity and shortened telomeres among 1999-2002  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) subjects. METHODS: We  performed a cross-sectional analysis of 2,188 NHANES study participants with  available ANA and telomere length data. ANA testing was performed using indirect  immunofluorescence. Telomere lengths were measured via quantitative polymerase  chain reaction methods. Applying appropriate sample weighting techniques, we used  univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to assess the association  between shortened telomeres (i.e. lowest decile of the cohort) and ANA  seropositivity. RESULTS: ANAs were positive in 322 out of 2,188 (14.7\%, 95\% CI  13.3-16.3\%) individuals. Subjects with shortened telomeres were more likely to be  older (p{\textless}0.001), male (p=0.005), and have a cancer history (p{\textless}0.001). A higher  proportion of non-Hispanic white participants (61.6\% vs. 49.3\%) and a lower  proportion of non-Hispanic black participants (7.8\% vs. 17.9\%) had shortened  telomeres (p{\textless}0.001). Shortened telomeres were not independently associated with  ANA seropositivity (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 0.87-2.52, p=0.14). However, female sex (OR  1.91, 95\% CI 1.23-2.96, p=0.006), age ≥80 years (OR 2.06, 95\% CI 1.08-3.92,  p=0.03), and African American race (OR 1.58, 95\% CI 1.00-2.51, p=0.05) were  independent risk factors for ANA seropositivity. Neither sex nor race modified  the relationship between ANA seropositivity and telomere length. CONCLUSIONS:  Telomere erosion does not appear to be responsible for age-related increases in  the prevalence of ANA seropositivity.},

One proposed  mechanism is through chronic inflammation. The objective of this study was to  examine the association between endometriosis and uterine fibroids and biomarkers  of inflammation and cellular aging. Materials and Methods: We used data from the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2342; 1999-2002). Adjusted  logistic and linear regression were used to examine the association between these  two reproductive conditions and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; {\textgreater}3.0 mg/L) and  leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio), respectively. Given that a greater length  of time spent with a condition may represent persistence of an inflammatory  process, we further examined the association between time since disease diagnosis  on telomere length among the subset of women with diagnosed endometriosis and  fibroids. Results: Women with endometriosis had greater odds of having elevated  CRP than those without endometriosis (OR = 1.60; 95\% CI: 1.05 to 2.45). Women  with endometriosis had a shorter telomere length than women without endometriosis  (-3.4, 95\% CI: -7.3 to -0.3 in age-adjusted models and -2.9, 95\% CI: -8.8 to 3.5  in fully adjusted models). Telomeres were 1\% (95\% CI: -1.2 to -0.6) shorter for  every elapsed year since endometriosis diagnosis. No substantive patterns emerged  between uterine fibroids and CRP or telomere length. Conclusions: Women with  endometriosis (or a longer duration of time spent with endometriosis) had higher  inflammatory markers and shorter mean telomere length. These results provide  further insights into potential mechanisms linking endometriosis to chronic  disease and later-life health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organophosphate insecticides have been widely used for {\textgreater}30 years, and are reported to be associated with various age-related chronic diseases. While  shortening of telomere length has been considered as a marker of cellular aging,  only a few small studies have been conducted to examine any difference of  telomere length in workers exposed to organophosphates versus controls.  Epidemiologic studies of the dose-response associations between environmental  organophosphate exposure and telomere length in the general population are few.  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between levels of  organophosphate insecticide exposure and telomere length in the general  population. METHODS: We analyzed data for 1724 participants aged 20 years or more  from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002.  Organophosphate insecticide exposure was estimated using measures of urinary  concentrations for 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY) and six non-specific  dialkyl phosphate metabolites, e.g., diethyl thiophosphate (DETP). Multiple  linear regression was conducted to assess the association between organophosphate  exposure and telomere length. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic and  physical factors and urinary creatinine, participants in the second quartile for  urinary TCPY had 0.06 (95\% CI: 0.02-0.10) T/S ratio shorter telomere length than  those in the lowest quartile. By contrast, participants in the second and third  tertiles of urinary DETP had 0.08 (95\% CI: 0.02-0.14) and 0.06 (95\% CI,  0.01-0.11) T/S ratio longer telomere length than those in the lowest tertile. For  other five metabolites, there was no association with telomere length.  CONCLUSIONS: Levels of environmental exposures to certain organophosphate  insecticides may be linked to altered telomere length in adults in the general  population. Although our findings may need to be replicated, we provide the first  evidence that environmental exposure to organophosphates may contribute to the  alteration of telomere length, which is potentially related to biological aging  and to the development of various chronic diseases.},

However, no study has investigated the  association between magnesium intake and telomere length in adults with  hypertension. METHODS: Participants were included from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. Dietary  magnesium intake was assessed using the 24 - hour recall method and the telomere  length of leukocytes was measured using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A  multivariate regression model was then used to assess the association between  dietary magnesium intake and telomere length in adults with hypertension.  RESULTS: Our final analysis included 2199 hypertensive adults (46.79\% males) with  a mean dietary magnesium intake of 254.82±133.47 mg/day. Linear regression,  adjusted for race, sex, age, smoking, uric acid, and other variables, showed that  every 1 mg increase in dietary magnesium intake was associated with a 0.20 (95\%  CI: 0.01, 0.39, p = 0.043) longer telomere length in all participants. In the ≥45  years age group, there was a statistically significant association between the  telomere length and dietary magnesium (95\% CI: 0.16, 0.63, p {\textless}0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that increased magnesium intake is associated  with a longer telomere length in hypertensive adults, especially in those ≥45  years of age.

Moreover, no polysomnography  (PSG) studies on this association in a general population have been conducted.  Our study aimed to evaluate the association between snoring and leukocyte  telomere length (LTL) using PSG and a questionnaire. METHODS: A cross-sectional  PSG study embedded in a population-based cohort from the Korean Genome  Epidemiology Study was conducted in 2010-2013. During the same period,  questionnaire-based interviews, blood collection, and relative LTL assays were  conducted. A total of 887 Korean men and women aged 50-79 y with an  apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) {\textless} 15 determined in the PSG study were included in the  study. RESULTS: We observed that the percentage of time spent snoring during  sleep (\% time spent snoring) assessed by PSG was inversely associated with LTL  even after adjusting for potential risk factors and AHI. In the linear regression  association between tertiles of percentage of time spent snoring and  log-transformed LTL, coefficient estimates (P value) were -0.076 ({\textless} 0.05) for the  second tertile and -0.084 ({\textless} 0.01) for the third tertile compared with the bottom  tertile. When LTL was compared according to snoring status determined using PSG  and questionnaire information, both primary snorers and those with mild sleep  apnea (5 ≤ AHI {\textless} 15) had shorter LTL than nonsnorers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  suggest that snoring may influence telomere attrition independent of sleep apnea.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is telomere length related to parity among a nationally representative sample of US reproductive age women? SUMMARY ANSWER: History of  live birth was associated with shorter telomere length. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY:  Shorter telomeres have been linked with a range of chronic health conditions and  mortality and parity has been associated with health indicators. However, there  is a lack of research on how parity relates to telomere length. STUDY DESIGN,  SIZE, DURATION: This nationally representative, cross-sectional study included  1954 women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002,  the only survey period which includes measurement of telomere length.  PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women aged 20-44 were included. Parity,  defined as number of previous live births, was ascertained by questionnaire.  Leukocyte telomere length was measured by polymerase chain reaction and reported  as a ratio in relation to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). The relationship  between leukocyte T/S ratio and parity was examined using survey weighted linear  regression. Models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, BMI, income-to-poverty  ratio, education, early age at menarche and smoking status. MAIN RESULTS AND THE  ROLE OF CHANCE: Among reproductive age women in the US, the adjusted mean  leukocyte T/S ratio was 4.2\% (95\% CI: 0.9, 7.3) shorter in parous compared with  nulliparous women. Parity was associated with 116 fewer base pairs (95\% CI: 26,  204) on average, using estimated coefficients from the adjusted linear regression  models and mean covariate values. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was  cross-sectional and therefore was unable to establish temporality. The dataset  lacked information on social factors, stress and fertility status, which may help  explain these findings. Only two previous studies have examined this question and  our findings should be interpreted with caution. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE  FINDINGS: These findings in a nationally representative sample of US reproductive  age women suggest that history of live birth may be associated with accelerated  cellular aging. The magnitude of the observed association was greater than that  of the impact of smoking or obesity on telomere length, suggesting that parity  may have an independent influence on cellular aging and warrant further study.  STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was funded in part by the  Undergraduate Research Scholars Program at George Mason University. The authors  have no conflicts of interest.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 710 women aged 35-60  years and 539 men aged 20-85 years were included from two cycles of the NHANES  (1999-2002). Telomere length relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio) was  measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Seven hormones in  serum (5 in men and 2 in women) were assayed. Logistic regressions were used to  calculate the odds ratios to evaluate the telomere length-sex hormones  association. RESULTS: Men with vigorous physical activity (71.1\%) and without  history of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and lipid-lowering drugs using  tended to have a longer telomere length (all P-values {\textless} 0.05); while women with  longer sedentary time, smaller pregnant or live birth, and with older ages of  firth/last birth were likely with longer telomere length (all P-values {\textless} 0.05).

Telomere length is a good indicator of the senescence of cells. The  purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between nuts and  seeds intake and leukocyte telomere length, a biomarker of biologic aging.  DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,582 randomly  selected men and women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  (NHANES), 1999-2002, were studied. MEASUREMENTS: DNA was obtained via blood  samples. Telomere length was assessed using the quantitative polymerase chain  reaction method. A validated, multi-pass, 24-h recall dietary assessment,  administered by NHANES, was employed to quantify consumption of nuts and seeds.  RESULTS: Nuts and seeds intake was positively and linearly associated with  telomere length. For each 1-percent of total energy derived from nuts and seeds,  telomere length was 5 base pairs longer (F=8.6, P=0.0065). Given the age-related  rate of telomere shortening was 15.4 base pairs per year (F=581.1, P{\textless}0.0001),  adults of the same age had more than 1.5 years of reduced cell aging if they  consumed 5\% of their total energy from nuts and seeds. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption  of nuts and seeds accounts for meaningful decreases in biologic aging and cell  senescence. The findings reinforce the recommendations of the 2015-2020 Dietary  Guidelines for Americans, which encourage the consumption of nuts and seeds as  part of a healthy diet.},

We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for 1999  to 2002, accounting for complex sampling and survey design. Of the 8892 eligible  participants, 47.8\% (n = 4123) were men. Mean serum high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol concentrations significantly increased across increasing TL quarters  ( P = .013), and mean fat mass, fat-free mass, hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and  C-reactive protein significantly decreased across increasing TL quarters (all P {\textless}  .001) in men. Only HbA(1c) levels significantly decreased across increasing TL  quarters ( P = .041) in women. Males in the upper quarter of TL had lower (38\%)  odds of prevalent metabolic syndrome compared with those in the lower quarter ( P  {\textless} .001).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aetiology of diabetes is complex with limited treatment strategies. Growing animal studies have shown that targeted antiageing can  improve the outcomes of diabetes. However, population evidence is limited. This  study aims to evaluate the associations of biological ageing with all-cause and  cause-specific mortality among people with diabetes. METHODS: A total of 5278  people with diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  1999-2014 were included. Biological ageing was measured from different  perspectives, including phenotypic age, biological age, telomere length and  klotho concentration. Phenotypic/biological age acceleration was the residual  resulting from a linear model when regressing phenotypic/biological age on  chronological age. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the  relationships between ageing and all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and  cancer mortality. RESULTS: Over median follow-up for 7.3 years, 1355 diabetics  died. There was a positive and linear association of mortality with phenotypic  age acceleration (HR(all-cause) 1.04; HR(CVD) 1.04; HR(cancer) 1.04, p{\textless}0.001) and  biological age acceleration (HR(all-cause) 1.03; HR(CVD) 1.04; HR(cancer) 1.03,  p{\textless}0.001). Telomere length was inversely associated with all-cause mortality  (tertile (T)3 vs T1: HR 0.67, p{\textless}0.05). The concentration of klotho had a U-shaped  relationship with mortality (T2 vs T1: HR(all-cause) 0.62; HR(CVD) 0.48;  HR(cancer) 0.47, p{\textless}0.05). Further, stratified analysis by age and sex found that  the associations of ageing-related markers with mortality were more significant  in the aged and female subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Biological ageing was positively  associated with mortality among people with diabetes, indicating therapies  targeting antiageing could be encouraged to halt the progression of diabetes.},

METHODS: A total of 5826 adults from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were studied cross-sectionally. Using the  quantitative polymerase chain reaction method, telomere length was compared to  standard reference DNA. Caffeine intake from foods and beverages and coffee  consumption were measured using a validated, multi-pass, computer-assisted, 24-h  recall system administered by NHANES interviewers. The following covariates were  controlled: age, gender, race, marital status, education, housing, smoking, BMI,  physical activity, alcohol use, and coffee intake (or caffeine consumption).  RESULTS: Caffeine consumption was inversely related to telomere length (F = 15.1,  P = 0.0005). For each 100 mg of caffeine consumed, telomeres were 35.4 base pairs  shorter, after adjusting for the covariates. For each 100 mg of caffeine consumed  among coffee drinkers only, telomeres were 36.7 base pairs shorter (F = 9.0, P =  0.0054), and among non-coffee drinkers only, 40.0 base pairs shorter (F = 8.5, P  = 0.0067). Conversely, coffee intake was positively related to telomere length (F  = 12.6, P = 0.0013), independent of the covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest  that caffeine consumption accounts for shorter telomeres in U.S. adults,  independent of numerous covariates, whereas coffee intake predicts longer  telomeres.},

Stratifying by age (20-50 years, {\textgreater} 50 years), we employed  multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic splines and interaction test  to investigate age-influenced telomere length in relation to migraine. In  participants aged 20-50 years, the odds ratio (OR) for migraine in the shortest  telomere length group T1 (0.39-0.89) was 1.35 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]  1.01, 1.79) compared to the longest group T3 (1.10-9.42), whereas in those  aged {\textgreater} 50 years, the OR of T1 was 0.93 (95\% CI 0.60, 1.43). Additionally,  telomere length and age interacted in the development of migraine (p for  interaction: 0.010). In individuals aged 20-50, an L-shaped relationship was  found between telomere length and migraine, with an inflection point at 1.02T/S  ratio. The OR was 9.34 (95\% CI 1.56, 55.99) for telomere lengths {\textless} 1.02T/S ratio.  These findings suggest age influences the association between telomere length and  migraine in U.S. adults.},

The limited research available has linked acculturation with shortened  telomere length. Objectives: To identify acculturation profiles among a US  representative sample of Hispanics/Latinos and to then examine telomere length  differences between profiles. Methods: We conducted a latent class analysis among  a non-institutionalized US-representative sample of Hispanics/Latinos using the  1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2,292). The  latent variable of acculturation was assessed by length of time in the US and  language used as a child, read and spoken, usually spoken at home, used to think,  and used with friends (i.e., Spanish and/or English). Telomere length assessed  from leukocytes was used as the distal continuous outcome. Results: We identified  five profiles: (1) low acculturated [33.2\% of sample]; (2) partially integrated  [18.6\% of sample]; (3) integrated [19.4\% of sample]; (4) partially assimilated  [15.1\% of sample]; and (5) assimilated [13.7\% of sample]. Acculturation profiles  revealed nuanced differences in conditional probabilities with language use  despite the length of time spent in the US. While telomere length did vary, there  were no significant differences between profiles. Conclusion: Profiles identified  revealed that possible life-course and generational effects may be at play in the  partially assimilated and assimilated profiles. Our findings expand public health  research using complex survey data to identify and assess the dynamic  relationship of acculturation profiles and health biomarkers, while being among  the first to examine this context using a person-centered approach.},

Consumption of a healthy diet may contribute to longevity via its impact on  cellular ageing, but studies on diet and telomere length to date have been  limited and their findings equivocal. The aim of this study was to examine  associations between three indices of diet quality and telomere length in older  men and women. METHODS: Adults aged 57-68 years participating in the Wellbeing,  Eating and Exercise for a Long Life (WELL) study in Victoria, Australia  (n = 679), completed a postal survey including an 111-item food frequency  questionnaire in 2012. Diet quality was assessed via three indices: the Dietary  Guideline Index, the Recommended Food Score, and the Mediterranean Diet Score.  Relative telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Associations between diet quality and telomere length were assessed using linear  regression adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex,  education, smoking, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI), there were no  significant associations between diet quality and relative telomere length.  CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of older adults residing in Victoria, Australia, men and  women aged 57-68 years with better-quality diets did not have longer telomeres.  Further investigation in longitudinal studies will determine whether diet can  influence telomere length over time in an ageing population.},

We systematically  associated 461 indicators of environmental exposures, physiology and  self-reported behaviour with telomere length in data from the US National Health  and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2002. Further, we tested  whether factors identified in the NHANES participants are also correlated with  gene expression of telomere length modifying genes. METHODS: We correlated 461  environmental exposures, behaviours and clinical variables with telomere length,  using survey-weighted linear regression, adjusting for sex, age, age squared,  race/ethnicity, poverty level, education and born outside the USA, and estimated  the false discovery rate to adjust for multiple hypotheses. We conducted a  secondary analysis to investigate the correlation between identified  environmental variables and gene expression levels of telomere-associated genes  in publicly available gene expression samples. RESULTS: After correlating 461  variables with telomere length, we found 22 variables significantly associated  with telomere length after adjustment for multiple hypotheses. Of these  varaibales, 14 were associated with longer telomeres, including biomarkers of  polychlorinated biphenyls([PCBs; 0.1 to 0.2 standard deviation (SD) increase for  1 SD increase in PCB level, P  {\textless} 0.002] and a form of vitamin A, retinyl  stearate. Eight variables associated with shorter telomeres, including biomarkers  of cadmium, C-reactive protein and lack of physical activity. We could not  conclude that PCBs are correlated with gene expression of telomere-associated  genes. CONCLUSIONS: Both environmental exposures and chronic disease-related risk  factors may play a role in telomere length. Our secondary analysis found no  evidence of association between PCBs/smoking and gene expression of  telomere-associated genes. All correlations between exposures, behaviours and  clinical factors and changes in telomere length will require further  investigation regarding biological influence of exposure.},

Carotenoids as antioxidants are favorably associated with health- and  aging-related diseases caused by oxidative stress, but their association with  telomere length is less certain. We investigated the association between blood  carotenoid levels and leukocyte telomere length in a representative sample of US  adults. METHODS: We analyzed 3660 participants aged 20 years and older in the  1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The levels of  carotenoids-alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans + cis), beta-cryptoxanthin,  combined lutein/zeaxanthin, and trans-lycopene-were measured using  high-performance liquid chromatography. The leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio)  was assayed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: A  doubling of blood alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans + cis), and  beta-cryptoxanthin was associated with approximately 2 \% longer telomeres.  Compared with the lowest carotenoid quartile of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene  (trans + cis), and beta-cryptoxanthin, telomere length for adults with the  highest quartiles was significantly increased by 5-8 \%. CONCLUSION: We found that  increasing levels of blood carotenoid were significantly associated with longer  leukocyte telomeres in US adults. High intake of carotenoid-rich food may play a  role in protecting telomeres and regulating telomere length.},

Telomere  shortening has been linked to cancers and other chronic diseases in adults,  although evidence for causal associations is limited. The aim of this study was  to determine whether nutritional factors are associated with telomere length (TL)  in children. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of nutritional factors  and TL in 437 children between 2009 and 2011. Healthy children ages 3, 6, and 9 y  provided blood samples, and their parents completed a food frequency  questionnaire and a telephone interview about relevant environmental exposures.  TL and blood micronutrient levels were measured, and genotyping at 10 loci was  undertaken. Associations between the micronutrients and other variables were  assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: No significant main or interactive  effects of age or sex were seen. After adjustment for age, sex, parental  education, and month of blood collection, TL was inversely associated with plasma  zinc, and shorter in children with the homozygous mutant genotype of the RFC G80A  (rs1051266) polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the  first investigation of the association between telomere length and micronutrients  in healthy children. The reason for the inverse relationship of TL with zinc is  unknown but could be the result of an increase in telomere sequence deletions  caused by labile zinc induction of oxidative stress. These findings should be  corroborated in other studies before nutritional recommendations might be  considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evidence on the association between cobalamin (Cbl) and aging or relevant outcomes is limited and controversial. We aimed to investigate the  relationships between cobalamin intake- and function-related biomarkers and  biological aging. METHODS: The study encompassed 22,812 participants aged 20  years and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A  panel of biomarkers or algorithms was used to assess biological aging, including  Klemera-Doubal Age Acceleration (KDMAccel), Phenotypic age acceleration  (PhenoAgeAccel), telomere length, α-Klotho, and PhenoAge advancement. Weighted  generalized linear regression analysis was used to assess the associations  between cobalamin-intake biomarkers (serum cobalamin, cobalamin intake from food,  cobalamin supplement use, serum methylmalonic acid [MMA], and homocysteine [Hcy])  and function-related biomarkers (functional cobalamin deficiency and cobalamin  insensitivity index). RESULTS: Among the 22,812 individuals, the weighted mean  (SE) age was 48.3 (0.2) years and 48.0\% were males. Unexpectedly, serum and  dietary cobalamin as well as serum MMA and Hcy levels were positively associated  with most indicators of biological aging. Cobalamin sensitivity was assessed by  the combination of binary Cbl(low/high) and MMA(low/high) or Hcy(low/high)  (cutoff values: 400 pg/mL for cobalamin, 250 nmol/L for MMA, and 12.1 μmol/l for  Hcy) and a newly constructed cobalamin insensitivity index (based on the  multiplicative term of serum cobalamin and serum MMA or Hcy). The  multivariable-adjusted β (95\%CIs) of KDMAccel in the MMA(low)Cbl(low),  MMA(low)Cbl(high), MMA(high)Cbl(low), and MMA(high)Cbl(high) groups were  reference, 0.27 (0.03 to 0.51), 0.85 (0.41 to 1.29), and 7.97 years (5.77 to  10.17) respectively, which were consistent for the combination of serum Hcy and  cobalamin. Both cobalamin insensitivity indices were robustly associated with  biological aging acceleration in a dose-response pattern (each p {\textless} 0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: Decreased cobalamin sensitivity but not cobalamin insufficiency  might be associated with biological aging acceleration. Further studies would  improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms between decreased cobalamin  sensitivity and biological aging acceleration.},

Few studies have focused on  the association between telomere length (TL) and kidney function. OBJECTIVE: We  investigated the association between TL and kidney function/prevalent chronic  kidney disease (CKD) in US adults. METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) participants with measured data on kidney function  and TL from 1999 to 2002 were included. Estimated glomerular filtration rate  (eGFR) was based on CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Urinary  albumin excretion was assessed using urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). We  used multivariable adjusted linear and logistic regression models, accounting for  the survey design and sample weights. RESULTS: Of the 10568 eligible  participants, 48.0\% (n=5020) were men. Their mean age was 44.1 years. eGFR  significantly decreased and ACR significantly increased across increasing  quarters of TL (all p{\textless}0.001). The association between TL and kidney function  remained robust even after adjusting for potential confounding factors, but the  association between TL and ACR was only borderline significant (β-coefficient=  -0.012, p=0.056). CONCLUSION: The association of kidney function with a marker of  cellular senescence suggests an underlying mechanism influencing the progression  of nephropathy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Hysterectomy is one of the most common gynecological surgical procedures, and most hysterectomies are performed for benign indications. Despite  the frequency and known benefits of the procedure, it remains unclear whether it  has potential adverse effects on long-term health and longevity. The aim of this  study was to evaluate the association of age at benign hysterectomy with  leukocyte telomere length, in data from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2002. STUDY DESIGN: In total, 811 women  who had a hysterectomy were included in this cross-sectional study. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURES: To estimate the association of age at benign hysterectomy with telomere  length, multivariate regression analyses adjusted for age, race/ ethnicity,  education, marital status, income poverty ratio, body mass index (BMI), physical  activity, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, history of chronic disease and  history of oophorectomy were conducted. Fitted smoothing curves were also  evaluated. RESULTS: We found leukocyte telomere length was positively correlated  with age at benign hysterectomy after adjusting for other confounders in both a  minimally adjusted model [β = 4.18, 95\%CI: (0.17,8.20)] and a fully adjusted  model [β = 4.63, 95\% CI:(0.56,8.70)]. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier age at benign  hysterectomy was associated with shorter telomere length in a nationally  representative population of women. These data provide new information in  pre-surgical counseling and decision-making.},

However, the impact of telomere length on  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and advanced fibrosis in a large national  population sample is not well understood. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 were utilized.  Suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed if serum alanine  aminotransferase was {\textgreater}30 IU/L for men and {\textgreater}19 IU/L for women in the absence of  other causes of chronic liver disease. Presence of advanced fibrosis was  determined by the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score, aspartate  aminotransferase to platelet ratio index and FIB-4 score. RESULTS: Of the 6738  participants (mean age 46.3 years, 48.4\% male), suspected nonalcoholic fatty  liver disease prevalence was inversely associated with leucocyte telomere length  in young adults aged 20-39 years, though this was not seen in the overall  population. Percentage of participants with advanced fibrosis increased  corresponding with leucocyte telomere length (longest to shortest). The shortest  quartile of leucocyte telomere length was associated with a significantly higher  odds ratio (95\% confidence interval) of advanced fibrosis of 2.36 (1.32-4.24) in  a univariate model compared to the longest quartile, and 2.01 (1.13-3.58) in a  multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, waist circumference,  smoking, diabetes, hypertension, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (P for trend {\textless}.05 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this large  nationally representative sample of American adults, leucocyte telomere  shortening was associated with increased risk of advanced fibrosis in the setting  of suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease independent of other known risk  factors.},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort using data from the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 to 2002 and the 2015  Linked Mortality File on adults 25 years or older (n = 6,526 and 1,753 deaths).  Cox proportional hazards regression was used to quantify the association of LTL  with each outcome adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and health-related  characteristics. We tested a three-way interaction for LTL, race and ethnicity,  and age groups. RESULTS: After adjustment, the rate of dying for all-cause and  CVD-specific mortality was at least 24\% lower for a 1 kilobase increase in LTL.  When compared with adults with the shortest telomere, the rates of dying were at  least 17\% lower for all-cause and CVD-specific mortality for those with longer  telomere. For all-cause mortality, increase LTL was associated with lower rate of  dying among non-Hispanic Blacks 45 years or older, and non-Hispanic Whites 65  years or older. CONCLUSIONS: We found that increase telomere length was  associated with lower all-cause and CVD-specific mortality rates among U.S.  adults.

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002, the current study assessed the effects of inflammation  and depression on telomere length in 1141 young adults in the USA. Depression  status was assessed from the World Health Organization Composite International  Diagnostic Interview and inflammation status was measured based on C-reactive  protein (CRP) concentrations. Information on telomere length was obtained using  the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method to measure telomere length  relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Unadjusted and adjusted linear  and logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between the  tertiles of CRP concentration and the telomere length stratified by the status of  depression such as major depression or depressed affect vs. no depression. The  adjusted models were controlled for age, family poverty income ratio,  race/ethnicity, marital status, physical activity, body mass index, and alcohol  drinking status. A significant and decreasing linear trend in telomere length was  found as CRP levels increased in men, regardless of the depression status, and  women with major depression or depressed affect (p values {\textless} 0.05). Among men  without depression, those with an elevated CRP level had increased odds of having  a shortened telomere length compared to men with low CRP levels after controlling  for covariates (adjusted odds ratio 1.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI)  1.09-2.90). In women, there was no association between CRP and telomere length,  regardless of the depression status. In conclusion, there was a significant and  inverse association between inflammation and telomere length according to the  depression status in men but not in women. The present findings may be of  clinical significance for the monitoring of inflammation levels and depression  status as determinants of telomere length.},

Growing evidence indicates that oxidative stress and inflammation  contributes to telomere shortening, whereas social support may protect from  telomere shortening. Despite sex differences in telomere length and social  support, little is known about whether there are sex differences in the  relationship between oxidative stress/inflammation and telomere length, and  sex-specific moderating roles of social support in older adults. Using data from  the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002, this  study assessed whether the associations between oxidative stress/inflammation and  telomere length vary with sex and explored social support as a moderator in these  associations among 2289 older adults. Oxidative stress was measured based on  serum Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and inflammation was measured based on  C-reactive protein (CRP). After adjusting for the covariates, GGT was  significantly associated with telomere length in females only (β =  - 0.037, 95\%  CI =  - 0.070, - 0.005), while CRP was associated with telomere length in males  only (β =  - 0.019, 95\% CI =  - 0.035, - 0.002). Moreover, high social support  mitigated the negative association between GGT and telomere length, which was  more evident in females. Furthermore, social support moderated the association  between CRP and telomere length in males aged 70 and above. Our findings  indicated that biological mechanisms related to telomere length may vary with  sex, while social support plays a sex-specific moderating role.},

METHODS: Participants older than 40 with linked leukocyte telomere  length (LTL) were enrolled in NHANES. LTL was assayed using qPCR from the  participants' blood samples. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the  better-seeing eye was analyzed, with visual impairment (VI) defined as  BCVA ≥ 20/40. LTL was grouped into quartiles, and its association with BCVA and  VI was evaluated after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Among the 4,480  enrolled participants, the weighted means of age, BCVA, and telomere length were  56.1 ± 11.9 years, 0.05 ± 0.08 logMAR, and 5,662 ± 36 base pairs, respectively.  The proportion of VI was 2.6\%. After adjusting for covariates including sex,  ethnicity, education, family poverty income ratio, general health status,  hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and body mass index, BCVA was significantly  worse in participants with shorter LTL, with a significant trend (p = 0.002).  However, after further adjusting for age, the association between LTL and BCVA  was no longer significant, without a trend (p = 0.640). No significant  association or trend between LTL and VI was found in the stepwise logistic model.  CONCLUSIONS: No age-independent association between LTL and BCVA was found.

Telomere length was linearly  related to F\&V intake when combined (F = 22.7, p {\textless} 0.0001) and also when  separated as fruit (F = 7.2, p {\textless} 0.0121) or vegetables (F = 15.4, p {\textless} 0.0005),  after adjusting for covariates. Specifically, telomeres were 27.8 base pairs  longer for each 100 g (3.5 ounces) of F\&V consumed. Because each additional year  of chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 14.9 base pairs  shorter, when women and men were analyzed together, results indicated that a 100  g (3.5 oz) per day increment in F\&V corresponded with 1.9 years less biological  aging. When the 75th percentile of F\&V intake was compared to the 25th, the  difference was 4.4 years of cellular aging. When separated by sex, fruits and  vegetables were both related to telomere length in women, but only vegetable  intake was predictive of telomere length in men.

Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to  investigate the relationship between circulating sex steroid hormones and SHBG  with leukocyte telomere length among 499 males in NHANES (1999-2002 surveys).  Sample-weighted linear regression analyses were conducted to assess age-adjusted  and multivariable-adjusted estimates of associations. Estimates were rescaled to  represent telomere length change in base pairs per half the value of the  interquartile range of the independent variable. Estradiol and free estradiol  were significantly inversely associated with leukocyte telomere length  (β(continuous per §)(IQR)( ) = -61, p = 0.04; free estradiol β(continuous per  §)(IQR)( ) = -67, p = 0.03). Testosterone, free testosterone, androstanediol  glucuronide, and SHBG were not associated with leukocyte telomere length. The  inverse association seen in this study indicates that a danazol-induced  hypoestrogenic state could partly underlie the previously observed association  between danazol therapy and increased leukocyte telomere length.},

This study investigated the associations between mean  telomere length (MTL) and low-, speech-, and high-frequency hearing threshold  shifts of adults in the United States. METHODS: A total of 2,027 adults, aged  20-69 years, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES,  1999-2002) were included in the analytic sample. The quantitative polymerase  chain reaction method was used for the MTL assay, and MTL was expressed using the  telomere-to-single copy gene (T/S) ratio. Hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone  average (PTA) for the better ear at ≥ 20 dB HL at frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000,  and 4,000 Hz. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses and smooth  curve fittings were conducted to evaluate the correlation between MTL and low-,  speech-, and high-frequency hearing levels. RESULTS: The mean age of the  participants was 40.60 ± 12.76 years, including 952 men (weighted, 48.67\%) and  303 (weighted, 12.88\%) participants with hearing loss. After adjusting for  potential confounders in the multivariate linear regression model, the  relationship between MTL and hearing thresholds was not statistically  significant. Smooth curve fittings indicated a non-linear relationship between  MTL and high-frequency PTA hearing threshold shifts. MTL was inversely related to  high-frequency PTA to the turning point (T/S ratio = 0.82) (adjusted β-21.45, 95\%  CI -37.28, -5.62; P = 0.008). When the T/S ratio exceeded0.82, MTL was not  associated with high-frequency PTA (adjusted β0.18, 95\% CI -2.21, 2.57; P =  0.8809). CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that MTL was associated with  high-frequency PTA hearing threshold shifts of adults in the United States in a  non-linear manner.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker of biologic age. Whether food security status modulates LTL is still unknown. We  investigated the association between food security and LTL in participants of the  1999-2002 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS:  Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate the association between food  security categories and LTL controlling for sex, race, and education and  accounting for the survey design and sample weights. RESULTS: We included 10,888  participants with 5228 (48.0\%) being men. They were aged on average 44.1 years.  In all, 2362 (21.7\%) had less than high school, 2787 (25.6\%) had achieved high  school, while 5705 (52.5\%) had done more than high school. In sex-, race-, and  education-adjusted ANCOVA, average LTL (T/S ratio) for participants with high  food security versus those with marginal, low, or very low food security was 1.32  versus 1.20 for the age group 25-35 years and 1.26 versus 1.11 for the 35-45  years, (p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: The association between food insecurity and LTL  shortening in young adults suggest that some of the future effects of food  insecurity on chronic disease risk in this population could be mediated by  telomere shortening.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental stressors can lead to shorter leukocyte telomere length and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Preservation of  leukocyte telomere length by reducing oxidative stress exposure and reinforcing  immunity may be a mechanism by which nutritional factors delay or prevent chronic  disease development. METHODS: Healthy pregnant women (aged 18-45 years) at  9-15 weeks of gestation living in Gasabo District, Kigali, Rwanda, were recruited  from 10 health centers for a prospective, longitudinal study from September to  October 2017 to determine possible associations between nutrition health,  infectious disease and leukocyte telomere length. Anthropometric and laboratory  measurements were performed using standard procedures; sociodemographic  parameters and health histories were assessed via surveys, and leukocyte telomere  length was assessed using quantitative PCR expressed as the ratio of a telomeric  product to a single-copy gene product (T/S). RESULTS: Mean gestational age of  participants (n = 297) at enrollment was 13.04 ± 3.50 weeks, age was  28.16 ± 6.10 years and leukocyte telomere length was 1.16 ± 0.22 (T/S). Younger  age; no schooling vs. primary schooling; and lower levels of ferritin, soluble  transferrin receptors and retinol-binding protein were independent predictors of  longer telomere length in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte telomere  length is an indicator of biological aging in pregnant Rwandan women. Maternal  micronutrient status, specifically lower ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor  levels, and retinol-binding protein levels were associated with longer maternal  telomere length in contrast with some studies from North America and Europe.  There were no associations between inflammation and infectious disease status and  maternal leukocyte telomere length. Further studies are needed to enhance our  understanding of the interplay between maternal nutritional status and infectious  disease in relation to leukocyte telomere length in developing countries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Double-strand break repair protein (RAD50) gene plays important roles in genomic integrity, DNA double-strand break repair, cell cycle checkpoint  activation, telomere maintenance, and meiotic recombination. The risk allele of  RAD50 may negatively affect cancer by reducing the DNA repair capacity.  Additionally, Sodium intake and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection are  major risk factors for gastric cancer (GC). Our study investigated the  association between polymorphisms in RAD50 gene and the risk of GC case-fatality.  We evaluated whether the association differed with sodium intake or H. pylori  infection. METHODS: We enrolled 490 patients from two hospitals between 2002 and  2006. Their survival or death was prospectively followed up until December 31,  2016, through a review of medical records and telephone surveys. The GC survival  was assessed using the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: In  319 GC cases, the total person-years were 1928.3, and the median survival years  was 5.4 years. A total of 137 GC deaths were recorded. Our fully adjusted model  showed that the GG type of RAD50 rs17772583 polymorphism is significantly  associated with an increased risk of GC case-fatality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.20,  95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-3.77) compared to that associated with the  homozygous AA type. In the high sodium intake group, patients with the GG type of  RAD50 rs17772583 showed a significantly higher GC case-fatality (HR = 8.61, 95\%  CI = 2.58-26.68) than that of patients with homozygous AA type. In the  positive-H. pylori infection group, patients with GG-type RAD50 rs17772583 showed  a significantly higher GC case-fatality (HR = 10.11, 95\% CI = 2.81-36.35) than  that of with AA homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GG-type RAD50 rs17772583,  high sodium intake, or a positive-H. pylori infection are at a significantly  increased risk of GC case-fatality compared to that associated with the absence  of these risk factors.},

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the  association between adherence to PHD, as quantified by the Planetary Health Diet  Index (PHDI), and biological aging in American populations. METHODS: Data were  obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for  1999-2018. Food consumption information was relied on two 24-h diet recall  questionnaires. The biological aging condition was comprehensively assessed by  four biological markers, including phenotypic age, biological age, telomere  length, and klotho concentration. Weighted multivariate linear models, restricted  cubic spline (RCS), and subgroup analysis were subsequently carried out to  evaluate the influence of PHDI on biological aging. RESULTS: 44,925 participants  with complete data were finally enrolled in our study. The fully adjusted models  showed decreased 0.20 years in phenotypic age [-0.20 (-0.31, -0.10)] and declined  0.54 years in biological age [-0.54 (-0.69, -0.38)] correlated with PHDI per 10  scores increment. Klotho concentration [6.2 (1.0, 11.0)] was positively related  to PHDI. In Model 2, telomere length increased by 0.02 bp for every 10-point rise  in PHDI. Besides, the RCS analysis results exhibited a curvilinear relationship  between PHDI and four indicators. CONCLUSION: Our study explored a significant  correlation between PHDI and biological aging, indicating that adherence to PHD  may prevent biological aging.},

For telomere length  analysis, a blood sample was obtained from each participant, followed by  real-time qPCR, and sociodemographic and health information was collected through  interviews. Food security/insecurity was measured using the reduced version of  the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Descriptive analysis and multiple logistic  regression were performed to analyze the factors associated with shorter telomere  length, adopting a significance level of 5\%. RESULTS: We found that food  insecurity was significantly associated with shorter telomere length, regardless  of age group, skin color, tabagism, physical activity, milk and dairy  consumption, living arrangement, and basic activities of daily life.

This study examined whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the Dietary  Inflammatory Index(TM) (DII) has an impact on telomere shortening in the National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We also carried out validation  of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Data came from  NHANES 1999-2002. LTL and CRP were assayed from leukocyte DNA and serum  specimens, respectively. The DII was calculated from food intakes assessed using  24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 calories consumed. Associations were  examined using survey-based multivariable linear regression for log-transformed  LTL. After multivariable adjustment, higher DII scores (i.e. relatively more pro  inflammatory) were associated with shorter LTL both when used as continuous (b  =  -0.003; 95\% confidence interval [CI]  =  -0.005, -0.0002) and as quartiles  (b(DIIquartile4vs1)   =  -0.013; 95\% CI  =  -0.025, -0.001; P(trend)   =  .03).  In this same sample the DII also was associated with CRP ≥3 mg/L  (OR(DIIcontinuous) = 1.10; 95\% CI = 1.06, 1.16). CONCLUSION: In these NHANES data  there was an association between DII and LTL. This study also provided a  successful construct validation of the DII using CRP in a nationally  representative sample. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that  diet-associated inflammation determines LTL.},

The  study designed to examine the joint effect of T2D and LTL on the probability of  death in American adults. METHODS: A cohort of 6862 adults with LTL measurements  and with or without T2D from the NHANES 1999-2002 with follow-up information  until 2015 was studied. Quantitative PCR was used to measure the length of  telomeres relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Individuals were  grouped into three tertiles according to the LTL levels, with the first tertile  demonstrating the lowest one and used as the reference group. The effects of LTL  and T2D status on death were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves along with  log-rank test. Three Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for various  confounders were used to examine the links between TL and all-cause death  possibility using adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Adults in the sample  averaged 45.54 years of age, with 49.51\% being male. After a median follow-up  period of 14.4 years, 1543 (22.5\%) individuals died from all cause. The  probability of all-cause mortality was higher among individuals with LTL in the  highest tertile than individuals in the lowest tertile (aHR = 0.89; 95\%CI:  0.77-1.03); however, the difference did not reach the level of statistical  significance (P = 0.11). Conversely, the individuals with T2D had a higher  probability of death than individuals without (aHR = 1.26; 95\%CI: 1.06-1.50; P =  0.0092). When LTL and T2D status were investigated jointly, subjects in the  highest TLT tertile and with T2D had the highest probability of mortality  compared with their counterparts (aHR = 1.34; 95\%CI: 1.07-1.68; P = 0.0101).  However, there was no independent effect of low TLT on mortality as demonstrated  among individuals with diabetes (aHR = 1.14; 95\%CI: 0.95-1.38; P = 0.1662).  CONCLUSION: The joint effect of TLT and T2D was larger than the sum of the  independent effects on the risk of all-cause death. Participants with high TLT  and diabetes showed the highest possibility of death compared with other groups.},

	abstract = {Chronic pain is a common condition associated with psychological distress, functional impairments, and age-associated comorbidity. Preliminary studies, on  the basis of relatively small sample sizes, suggest that the combination of  chronic pain and stress is associated with telomere shortening, a widely  recognized marker of cellular aging. We sought to determine the cross-sectional  association of chronic pain with telomere length in 7,816 community-dwelling  adults ages 20 years and older who participated in the 1999 to 2002 National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Consistent with previous studies,  leukocyte telomere length was assessed using the quantitative polymerase chain  reaction method and compared with a DNA reference standard to compute a telomere  to single copy gene ratio. Standardized, in-person interviews were used to  identify chronic regional pain and chronic widespread pain in 784 (10.0\%) and 266  (3.4\%) participants, respectively. Older age, male sex, obesity, and less  physical activity were associated with shorter telomere length (P {\textless}.05 for all  comparisons); however, there was no association of chronic pain with telomere  length. The age-adjusted means (standard error) of telomere length telomere to  single copy gene ratios were 1.04 (.02), 1.03 (.02), and 1.02 (.02) in  participants with no chronic pain, chronic regional pain, and chronic widespread  pain, respectively (P = .69). In addition, chronic pain did not modify the  effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, or psychological distress on  telomere length. In summary, chronic regional and widespread pain were not  associated with telomere length in this nationally representative study; however,  we could not determine associations of pain duration and severity with telomere  length because of limitations in pain assessment data. PERSPECTIVE: The findings  from the current study do not support the hypothesis that chronic pain  accelerates cellular aging measured according to leukocyte telomere length.  Additional population-based studies with more detailed assessments of pain and  stress are needed to further investigate potential interactive effects on  telomere length and other biomarkers of aging.},

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to dissect the direct effect of body mass index (BMI)  and its indirect effect through C-reactive protein (CRP) on leukocyte telomere  length (LTL) to determine the mediation effect of CRP on the BMI-LTL association.  METHODS: The study cohort included 5451 adults (1404 Mexican American, 3114  White, and 933 Black individuals; 53.5\% male; mean age = 49.2 years) from the  1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. General mediation  models were used to examine the mediation effect of CRP on the BMI-LTL  association. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, race, sex, physical activity,  alcohol use, and serum cotinine, the total effect of BMI on LTL was significant  (standardized regression coefficient, β = -.054, P {\textless} .001) without CRP included  in the model. With inclusion of CRP in the model, the indirect effect of BMI on  LTL through CRP was estimated at β equal to -.023 (P {\textless} .001), and the direct  effect of BMI on LTL in its absolute value decreased to β equal to -.031  (P = .025). The mediation effect of CRP was estimated at 42.6\%. The mediation  model parameters did not differ significantly between race and sex groups.  CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the inverse BMI-LTL association is partly  mediated by obesity-induced inflammation. The significant direct effect of BMI on  LTL with removal of the mediation effect through CRP indicates that obesity is  associated with LTL attrition also through other noninflammatory mechanisms.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Telomere length (TL) is related to age-related health outcomes, but little is known about the relationship between TL and complete blood count (CBC)  parameters. We aimed to determine the relationship between TL and CBC in a sample  of healthy US adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants in the National Health  and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) recruited between 1999 and 2002 who had  essential data on total CBC and TL were studied. We computed age- and  race-adjusted mean values for total CBC using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  All statistical analyses accounted for the survey design and sample weights by  using SPSS Complex Samples v22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Of the 8892  eligible participants, 47.8\% (n = 4123) were men. The mean age was 41.8 years  overall, 41.0 years in men and 42.6 in women (p = 0.238). The sex-stratified  ANCOVA showed no significant difference in the total CBC across TL quartiles (all  p {\textgreater} 0.05) in both sexes. In the adjusted model, there was a significant negative  relationship with monocyte count (β = -0.051, 95\% CI: -0.422; -0.142), mean cell  hemoglobin (β = -0.051, 95\% CI: -0.038; -0.011) and red cell distribution width  (β = -0.031, 95\% CI: -0.054; -0.003), while there was a significant positive  relationship with basophil ratio (β = 0.046, 95\% CI: 0.049-0.171). CONCLUSIONS:  These results support the possibility that telomere attrition may be a marker for  reduced proliferative reserve in hematopoietic progenitor cells.},

Response-surface methods estimate high-dimensional surfaces and are thus highly  flexible but difficult to interpret. In contrast, exposure-index methods  decompose coefficients from a linear model into an overall mixture effect and  individual index weights; these models yield easily interpretable effect  estimates and efficient inferences when model assumptions hold, but, like most  parsimonious models, incur bias when these assumptions do not hold. In this  paper, we propose a Bayesian multiple index model framework that combines the  strengths of each, allowing for non-linear and non-additive relationships between  exposure indices and a health outcome, while reducing the dimensionality of the  exposure vector and estimating index weights with variable selection. This  framework contains response-surface and exposure-index models as special cases,  thereby unifying the two analysis strategies. This unification increases the  range of models possible for analysing environmental mixtures and health,  allowing one to select an appropriate analysis from a spectrum of models varying  in flexibility and interpretability. In an analysis of the association between  telomere length and 18 organic pollutants in the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES), the proposed approach fits the data as well as more  complex response-surface methods and yields more interpretable results.},

We also examined moderating effects of age,  sex, race/ethnicity, and education. METHODS: Data were from the National Health  and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002 (n = 3,091). Cox proportional hazards  regression was used to estimate the risk of all-cause and cause- specific  mortality adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking, body mass  index, and chronic conditions. RESULTS: Eight hundred and seventy deaths occurred  over an average of 9.5 years of follow-up. In the full sample, a decrease of 1  kilobase pair in telomere length at baseline was marginally associated with a 10\%  increased hazard of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.1, 95\% confidence  interval [CI]: 0.9, 1.4) and a 30\% increased hazard of death due to diseases  other than cardiovascular disease or cancer (HR: 1.3, 95\% CI: 0.9, 1.9). Among  African-American but not white or Mexican-American respondents, a decrease of 1  kilobase pair in telomere length at baseline was associated with a two-fold  increased hazard of cardiovascular mortality (HR: 2.0, 95\% CI: 1.3, 3.1). There  was no association between telomere length and cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The  association between leukocyte telomere length and mortality differs by  race/ethnicity and cause of death.},

Although, telomere length (TL) and allostatic load score have each been  used as biological markers of stress, the relationship between these two measures  is unknown. METHODS: We investigated the association between leucocyte TL and  allostatic load score in 1503 non-pregnant women (20-44 years) participating in  the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002. We constructed  six different allostatic load scores using either quartile- or clinical-based  cut-points for 14 biomarkers based on previously published methods. We estimated  associations between TL and allostatic load scores and component biomarkers using  linear regression, also assessing interactions by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: After  adjustment for age, longer TL was associated with higher HDL cholesterol and  lower C-reactive protein and creatinine clearance; TL was not associated with the  other component biomarkers. Shorter TL was associated with higher allostatic load  scores for the two clinical cut-point-based scores after adjustment for age, but  not the four scores based on quartile cut-points. Significant interactions by  race/ethnicity were observed for TL and HbA1c and triglycerides, but not for  other component biomarkers or allostatic load scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although TL  and allostatic load score are both considered measures of cumulative stress, most  component biomarkers and scores using quartile-based cut-points were not  associated with TL. In reproductive-aged women, allostatic load scores using  clinical-based cut-points were more strongly associated with TL compared with  quartile-based scores.},

In the present study, we evaluated longitudinal associations  between the consumption of micronutrients, including antioxidant nutrients and B  vitamins involved in one-carbon transfer pathways, and leukocyte telomere length  (LTL). METHODS: The study included 1958 middle-aged and older Korean men and  women (age range at baseline: 40-69 years) from a population-based cohort. We  collected dietary information at baseline using a semiquantitative food frequency  questionnaire (June 2001 to January 2003) and assessed the consumption of  micronutrients, including vitamins A, B(1) , B(2) , B(3) , B(6) , B(9) (folate),  C and E, as well as calcium, phosphorus, potassium, iron and zinc. We measured  LTL using a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the 10-year follow-up  examination (February 2011 to November 2012). RESULTS: In the multiple regression  model adjusted for potential confounders, LTL was positively associated with the  consumption of vitamin C (P {\textless} 0.05), folate (P = 0.05) and potassium (P = 0.05)  in all participants. In the age-stratified analysis, the association between the  consumption of vitamin C (P {\textless} 0.01), folate (P {\textless} 0.05) and potassium (P {\textless} 0.05)  with LTL was significant only among participants aged {\textless}50 years.

Methods: We used epidemiological data from a large  national population-based health and nutrition survey. Dietary intake was  assessed during the 24-h period before the interview date when blood sample was  collected. Telomere length was measured from blood leukocyte using PCR method.  The relationship between telomere length and dietary copper intake was assessed  using multivariable linear regression models. We also examined if obesity,  measured by body mass index, could modify the observed association. Results:  There are 7,324 participants had both leukocyte telomere length measured and  dietary copper intake assessed, around 48.0\% of them were men. Telomere length  was longer in women than that in men (1.05 ± 0.26 vs. 1.00 ± 0.26 T/S ratio),  while dietary copper intake was less in women than that in men (1.12 ± 0.80 vs.  1.51 ± 1.61 mg). After controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, physical activity,  current smoking status, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and body mass  index in the multivariable linear regression models, one unit increase of  log-transformed dietary copper intake was significantly associated with longer  telomere length (β = 0.02, 95\% confidence interval: 0.01, 0.04). We did not find  a significant sex difference for this association.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Telomere length (TL) is a posited pathway through which chronic stress results in biological dysregulation and subsequent adverse health outcomes. Food  insecurity is associated with shorter TL. Social support, which is defined by the  size and function of an individual's social network, is associated with better  health outcomes. The present study assesses whether social support modifies the  relationship between food security and TL. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study design.  Linear regression was used to assess the association between food insecurity and  TL, stratified by social support level. A multiplicative interacted model was  used to formally test modification. SETTING: Data come from the National Health  and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 waves. PARTICIPANTS:  Adults aged 60 years and older who have measurements for TL. RESULTS: Our sample  comprised 2674 participants, and 63·5 \% of the total sample had low social  support, with 13·3 \% being food insecure. In fully adjusted models, food  insecurity was negatively though modestly associated (P = 0·13) with TL.  Associations between food insecurity and TL were significantly modified by social  support (interaction P = 0·026), whereby food insecurity had a stronger effect  among individuals with high social support (coefficient = -0·099 (95 \% CI:  -0·161, -0·038)) compared to low social support (coefficient = -0·001, (95 \% CI:  -0·033, 0·032)). CONCLUSION: Food insecurity is modestly associated with shorter  TL. Contrary to our hypothesis, food insecurity had more deleterious effects on  TL among participants with high social support than low social support. Results  may indicate that the food insecure population is a higher needs population, and  increased social support reflects these needs rather than providing protective  effects.},

Nutritional factors are  related to LTL in adulthood, but these associations are not well characterized in  children. We examined whether micronutrient status biomarkers were associated  with LTL in school-age children. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of  330 boys and 393 girls aged 5-12 years from Bogotá, Colombia. We quantified blood  concentrations of hemoglobin, ferritin, zinc, vitamin A, folate, and vitamin  B-12; and measured LTL using qPCR in DNA extracted from buffy coat. We estimated  mean differences in LTL by quartiles of micronutrient status biomarkers and  categories of relevant sociodemographic and anthropometric covariates with the  use of linear regression. RESULTS: In girls, plasma vitamin B-12 was positively  associated with LTL (adjusted LTL difference between extreme vitamin B-12  quartiles = 0.11; P, trend = 0.02). LTL was also positively associated with birth  order in girls (P, trend = 0.02). In boys, LTL was not related to the  micronutrient status biomarkers but, unexpectedly, it was positively associated  with birth weight (P = 0.02), height-for-age Z score (P, trend = 0.01), and serum  C-reactive protein (P, trend = 0.01).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length is associated with diseases of aging, but there is limited knowledge of diet and lifestyle determinants. OBJECTIVE: The  objective was to examine cross-sectionally the association between diet, body  composition, and lifestyle factors on leukocyte telomere length in women. DESIGN:  Leukocyte telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction  in 2284 female participants from the Nurses' Health Study, who were selected as  controls for an investigation of biological predictors of cancer. Diet,  lifestyle, and anthropometric data were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: After  multivariate adjustment, dietary fiber intake was positively associated with  telomere length (z score), specifically cereal fiber, with an increase of 0.19  units between the lowest and highest quintiles (P = 0.007, P for trend = 0.03).  Although total fat intake was not associated with telomere length,  polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (-0.26 units, quintile 5 compared with quintile  1: P = 0.002, P for trend = 0.02), specifically linoleic acid intake, was  inversely associated with telomere length after multivariate adjustment (-0.32  units; P = 0.001, P for trend = 0.05). Waist circumference was inversely  associated with telomere length [0.15-unit difference in z score in a comparison  of the highest ({\textgreater} or = 32 in, 81.28 cm) with the lowest ({\textless} or = 28 in, 71.12 cm)  category (P = 0.01, P for trend = 0.02) in the multivariate model]. We found no  association between telomere length and smoking, physical activity, or  postmenopausal hormone use. CONCLUSION: Although the strength of the associations  was modest in this population of middle- and older-age women, our results support  the hypothesis that body composition and dietary factors are related to leukocyte  telomere length, which is a potential biomarker of chronic disease risk.},

Weighted multiple  regression and partial correlation were used to calculate the mean differences in  telomere length across levels of strength training, adjusting for differences in  potential confounders. With the demographic covariates controlled, strength  training and telomere length were linearly related (F = 14.7, p = 0.0006).  Likewise, after adjusting for all the covariates, the linear association remained  strong and significant (F = 14.7, p = 0.0006). In this national sample, 90 min  per week of strength training was associated with 3.9 years less biological  aging, on average. Regular strength training was strongly related to longer  telomeres and less biological aging in 4814 US adults.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mildly increased bilirubin concentration has a protective effect on oxidative stress-related diseases. However, it remains unknown whether elevated  circulating bilirubin is associated with longer telomere length. The aim of this  cross-sectional study was to examine the association between total bilirubin  concentration and telomere length. METHODS: We used the data from the National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. The multivariable  linear regression model was used to examine the association between total  bilirubin concentration and telomere length. The nonlinear relationship was  analyzed using a generalized additive model with the smoothing plot. RESULTS: A  total of 7818 participants with a mean age of 49.20 ± 18.82 years were included.  Compared with the lowest concentration of total bilirubin (Q1), the highest  quartile of total bilirubin concentration was associated with longer telomere  length in male (β = 0.04, 95 CI\%: 0.00, 0.07, P = 0.024) and female (β = 0.04, 95  CI\%: 0.02, 0.04, P = 0.002). Furthermore, an inverted U-shaped relationship  between total bilirubin and telomere length was found. On the left of turning  points (total bilirubin {\textless} 0.5 mg/dL), total bilirubin concentration was  positively associated with telomere length (β = 0.23, 95 CI\%: 0.14, 0.32, P {\textless}  0.001). However, the association between total bilirubin concentration and  telomere length was not significant (β = 0.01, 95\% CI: -0.01, 0.04, P = 0.346)  above the turning point. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence based on a  nationally representative survey demonstrating a positive and nonlinear  association between total bilirubin concentration and telomere length. Future  large-scale prospective studies are warranted to confirm our findings.},

The objective of our research was to  examine this relationship in a representative, socioeconomically and  sex-specific, diverse racial/ethnic population in the United States. METHODS:  Body mass index (BMI), \% total body fat (TBF) and waist circumference (WC) with  leukocyte telomere length (LTL) were examined according to sex-specific  race/ethnicity using separate adjusted multivariate linear regressions on a  sample of 4,919 respondents aged 20-84 years from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey's 1999-2002 data. RESULTS: LTL was shortened .41\%,  .44\%, and .16\% in African American (AA) women and was associated with increasing  BMI, \%TBF, and WC, (β:-.0041, 95\%CI: -.0070, -.0012; P=.007; β:-.0044, 95\% CI:  -.0081, -.0007; P=.02; β:-.0016, 95\%CI: -.0031, -.0001; P=.04, respectively). LTL  was shortened .29\% in White women and was associated with increasing \%TBF  (β:-.0029, 95\%CI: -.0048, -.0009; P=.006). There were no associations among AA  men, White men or Mexican American men and women. CONCLUSIONS: LTL is associated  with an obesity phenotype in AA women.

	abstract = {The associations between milk intake frequency and milk fat consumption and telomere length, an index of biological aging, were studied using an NHANES  sample of 5,834 U.S. adults and a cross-sectional design. The milk consumption  variables were assessed with the NHANES Diet Behavior and Nutrition  questionnaire. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to  measure leukocyte telomere length. Results showed that milk consumption frequency  was not related to telomere length; however, there was a strong association  between milk fat intake and telomere length. With the sample delimited to milk  drinkers only, milk fat intake was linearly and inversely related to telomere  length, after adjusting for the covariates (F = 8.6, P = 0.0066). For each 1  percentage point increase in milk fat consumed (e.g., 1\% to 2\%), adults had more  than 4 years of additional biological aging. With milk fat intake divided into 5  categories (i.e., milk abstainers, nonfat, 1\%, 2\%, and full-fat milk), mean  telomere lengths differed across the categories (F = 4.1, P = 0.0093). The mean  telomere difference between the extremes of milk fat intake (nonfat vs. full-fat)  was 145 base pairs, representing years of additional biological aging for  full-fat milk consumers. Effect modification testing indicated that the milk fat  and cellular aging association may be partly due to saturated fat intake  differences across the milk fat groups. When the sample was delimited to adults  reporting only high total saturated fat intake (tertile 3), the milk fat and  telomere relationship was strong. However, when the sample was restricted to  adults reporting only low saturated fat consumption (tertile 1), there was no  relationship between milk fat intake and telomere length. Overall, the findings  highlight an association of increased biological aging in U.S. adults who  consumed high-fat milk. The results support the latest Dietary Guidelines for  Americans (2015-2020), which recommend consumption of low-fat milk, but not  high-fat milk, as part of a healthy diet.},

Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) decreases with age and is enhanced by  inflammation and oxidative stress. However, whether shorter LTL correlates with  cognitive decline remains controversial. AIMS: We aimed to investigate the  relationship between LTL and cognitive decline in the American elderly. METHODS:  We used data from the 1999 to 2002 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES). We included participants aged 65-80 with available data on LTL  and cognitive assessments. The cognitive function assessment used the digit  symbol substitution test (DSST). We applied multivariate modeling to estimate the  association between LTL and cognitive performance. Additionally, to ensure robust  data analysis, we converted LTL into categorical variables through quartile and  then calculated the P for trend. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, cardiovascular  disease (CAD) score, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and educational level,  LTL showed a positive correlation with DSST score (odds ratio [OR] 3.47 [0.14,  6.79], P = 0.04). Additionally, to further quantify the LTL-DSST interaction, we  found a similar trend when LTL was regarded as a categorical variable (quartile)  (P for trend = 0.03). CONCLUSION: LTL was associated with cognitive capabilities  among the elderly, implying that LTL might be a biomarker of cognitive aging.},

This finding suggests that intelligence  might influence mortality through its effects on a general process of  physiological deterioration (i.e., individual variation in "biological age"). We  examined whether intelligence could predict measures of aging at midlife before  the onset of most age-related disease. METHODS: We tested whether intelligence  assessed in early childhood, middle childhood, and midlife predicted midlife  biological age in members of the Dunedin Study, a population-representative birth  cohort. RESULTS: Lower intelligence predicted more advanced biological age at  midlife as captured by perceived facial age, a 10-biomarker algorithm based on  data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and  Framingham heart age (r = 0.1-0.2). Correlations between intelligence and  telomere length were less consistent. The associations between intelligence and  biological age were not explained by differences in childhood health or parental  socioeconomic status, and intelligence remained a significant predictor of  biological age even when intelligence was assessed before Study members began  their formal schooling. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that accelerated aging  may serve as one of the factors linking low early-life intelligence to increased  rates of morbidity and mortality.},

Potential mediating variables were controlled  using partial correlation. After adjusting for age, race, year, and housing  status, the association between percent weight change over 10 years and LTL was  significant in women (F = 6.9, p = 0.0138). Adjusting for the demographic and  several other covariates weakened the relationship slightly (F = 4.7, p =  0.0392). With all the covariates controlled, for each one percentage point  increase in weight over the previous 10 years, telomeres were, on average, 3.48  base pairs (bp) shorter in women. Given that each one-year increase in age was  associated with telomeres that were 15.0 bp shorter in women, the median weight  change in U.S. women over the previous 10 years (an increase of 10.4\%) was  predictive of LTLs that were 36 bp shorter, on average, or an increase of 2.4  years of biological aging.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a robust marker of biological aging, which is associated with obesity. Recently, the visceral adiposity index  (VAI) has been proposed as an indicator of adipose distribution and function.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluated the association between VAI and LTL in adult Americans.  METHODS: There were 3193 participants in U.S. National Health and Nutrition  Examination Surveys (1999-2002) included in this analysis. LTL was measured using  quantitative PCR (qPCR) and expressed as telomere to single-gene copy ratio (T/S  ratio). We performed multiple logistic regression models to explore the  association between VAI and LTL by adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS:  Among all participants, VAI was associated with the shorter LTL (β:  - 14.81, 95\%  CI  - 22.28 to  - 7.34, p {\textless} 0.001). There were significant differences of LTL in  VAI tertiles (p {\textless} 0.001). Participants in the higher VAI tertile had the shorter  LTL (1.26 ≤ VAI {\textless} 2.46: β =  - 130.16, 95\% CI [ - 183.44,  - 76.87]; VAI ≥ 2.46:  β =  - 216.12, 95\% CI [ - 216.12,  - 81.42], p for trend: {\textless} 0.001) comparing with  the lower VAI tertile. We also found a non-linear relationship between VAI and  LTL. VAI was negatively correlated with LTL when VAI was less than 2.84.  CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that VAI is independently associated  with telomere length. A higher VAI is associated with shorter LTL. The results  suggest that VAI may provide prediction for LTL and account for accelerating the  biological aging.},

The MTL was measured using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) method and expressed in telomere-to-single copy gene (T/S) ratio and  grouped into quartiles. Multivariate linear [expressed in beta and 95\% confidence  interval (CI)], logistic regression [odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% CI] analyses and  smooth curve fitting were performed to evaluate the relationship between MTL, BPs  and the likelihood of hypertension. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was  45.2±17.3 years, including 2,923 (48.9\%) males. After adjusting for potential  confounders, MLT was significantly related to the prevalence of hypertension (OR:  0.12, 95\% CI: 0.02, 0.94; P=0.04). Smooth curve fitting found a non-linear  relationship between MTL, the levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure  (SBP/DBP) and the prevalence of hypertension. The inflection points for the  smooth curve of MLT were at 0.86, 1.02 and 0.80 (T/S ratio) respectively. The  betas (95\% CIs) for SBP [-12.58 (-20.07, -5.09), P{\textless}0.01 and 2.25 (0.07, 4.43),  P=0.04] and DBP [4.88 (1.29, 8.47), P{\textless}0.01 and -3.30 (-5.54, -1.06), P{\textless}0.01], and  ORs (95\% CIs) for the prevalence of hypertension [0.02 (0.001, 9.71), P=0.15 and  0.26 (0.026, 2.60), P=0.25] on the left and right of the inflection point,  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that MTL was related with SBP,  DBP and the odds of hypertension in a non-linear manner.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Short leukocyte telomere length (LTL) has become a hallmark characteristic of aging. Some, but not all, evidence suggests that physical  activity (PA) may play an important role in attenuating age-related diseases and  may provide a protective effect for telomeres. The purpose of this study was to  examine the association between PA and LTL in a national sample of US adults from  the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. METHODS: National Health  and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 1999 to 2002 (n = 6503; 20-84 yr) were  used. Four self-report questions related to movement-based behaviors (MBB) were  assessed. The four MBB included whether individuals participated in  moderate-intensity PA, vigorous-intensity PA, walking/cycling for transportation,  and muscle-strengthening activities. An MBB index variable was created by summing  the number of MBB an individual engaged in (range, 0-4). RESULTS: A clear  dose-response relation was observed between MBB and LTL; across the LTL tertiles,  respectively, the mean numbers of MBB were 1.18, 1.44, and 1.54 (Ptrend {\textless} 0.001).  After adjustments (including age) and compared with those engaging in 0 MBB,  those engaging in 1, 2, 3, and 4 MBB, respectively, had a 3\% (P = 0.84), 24\% (P =  0.02), 29\% (P = 0.04), and 52\% (P = 0.004) reduced odds of being in the lowest  (vs highest) tertile of LTL; MBB was not associated with being in the middle (vs  highest) tertile of LTL. CONCLUSIONS: Greater engagement in MBB was associated  with reduced odds of being in the lowest LTL tertile.},

Telomere dysfunction is  implicated in some age-related and chronic diseases, but its association with  total serum lipids and obesity is unknown. Our objective was to determine  influenced of total serum lipids on leukocyte telomere lengths (TLs).  Participants were selected by cluster sampling from 22 districts of Tehran. The  questionnaires were completed by 500 subjects and after the initial assessment in  terms of lifestyle, nutrition, home, and job, 300 healthy people, aged 25-40  years were finally selected. TLs and serum level of total lipids were measured by  quantitative real-time PCR and the Phillips method, respectively. The average  telomere length (T/S) and total lipids were 1.05 ± 0.3 mg/dl and 643.3 ± 70.8  mg/dl, respectively. We found that a one unit difference in the following  parameters were associated with kilo base pair differences in TL: Age -0.0002  (95\% CI [-0.0022, -0.0018]), BMI -0.0019 (95\% CI [-0.0003, -0.0034]), TC 0.0001  (95\% CI [-0.0006, -0.0007]), TG -0.0010 (95\% CI [-0.0015, -0.0004]), PL 0.0001  (95\% CI [-0.0005, -0.0007]), and TSL -0.0003 (95\% CI [-0.0008, 0.0001]). Spearman  correlation analysis revealed an inverse relationship between TC (R = -0.53; 95\%  CI [-0.61, -0.44]), TG (R = -0.50; 95\% CI [-0.58, -0.41]), PL (R = -0.46; 95\% CI  [-0.54-0.36]), and TSL (R = -0.63; 95\% CI [-0.69, -0.56]) with T/S. Our research  suggests that the inverse relationship was found between TL and weight, BMI, age,  and TSL which were associated with obesity. High serum lipids concentration may  be associated with systemic inflammation and atherosclerosis and may lead to  oxidative stress, resulting in telomere shortening.},

Using data  from 773 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  (NHANES) conducted in 1999-2000, we analysed the association between blood PFC  concentrations and LTL. Coefficients (betas) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs)  for the blood PFC concentrations in association with the LTL were estimated using  multivariate linear regression models after adjustment for age, gender, race,  body mass index (BMI), poverty income ratio, educational level, white blood cell  count, C-reactive protein and other PFCs. The results identified a strong  positive association between the blood perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)  concentration and LTL in adults, and no associations were found between the LTL  and other PFCs. In the linear regression models, each increment of one standard  deviation (SD) in the base-10-logarithm-transformed PFOS concentration was  associated with a 21-bp increase in the LTL in the fully adjusted model  (P = 0.033). Moreover, serum PFOS was associated with the LTL mainly in females  and individuals aged 40-50, as demonstrated by stratified analyses. These results  provide epidemiological evidence showing that environment-related levels of serum  PFOS are positively associated with the LTL in adults.},

Our objective was to study the association  between fats, fruits, vegetables and LTL in a cross-sectional study design. We  hypothesized that intakes of fruits and vegetables would be positively associated  with LTL and that intakes of fats, and especially saturated fatty acids (SFAs),  would be negatively associated with LTL. SUBJECTS/METHODS: LTL was measured by  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 1942 men and women aged 57-70  years from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. We assessed the whole diet by a  validated semiquantitative 128-item food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: In  general, there were only a few significant results. However, total fat and SFA  intake (P=0.04 and 0.01, respectively) were inversely associated with LTL in men  adjusting for age and energy intake. In women, vegetable intake was positively  associated with LTL (P=0.05). Men consuming the most butter and least fruits had  significantly shorter telomeres than those consuming the lowest amounts of butter  and highest amounts of fruits (P=0.05). We found no association between LTL and  body mass index, waist-hip ratio, smoking, physical activity or educational  attainment. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of elderly men and women,  there were only a few statistically significant effects of diet, but in general  they support the hypothesis that fat and vegetable intakes were associated with  LTL.},

	abstract = {Despite racial disparities in diseases of aging and premature mortality, non-Hispanic Black Americans tend to have longer leukocyte telomere length (LTL),  a biomarker of cellular aging, than non-Hispanic White Americans. Previous  findings suggest that exposure to certain persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is  both racially-patterned and associated with longer LTL. We examine whether  Black/White differences in LTL are explained by differences in exposure to 15  POPs by estimating the indirect effect (IE) of self-reported race on LTL that is  mediated through nine polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), three furans, and three  dioxins, as well as their mixtures. Our study population includes 1,251 adults  from the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 cycles of the cross-sectional National Health  and Nutrition Examination Survey. We characterized single-pollutant mediation  effects by constructing survey-weighted linear regression models. We also  implemented various approaches to quantify a global mediation effect of all POPs,  including unpenalized linear regression, ridge regression, and examination of  three summary exposure scores. We found support for the hypothesis that exposure  to PCBs partially mediates Black/White differences in LTL. In single-pollutant  models, there were significant IEs of race on LTL through six individual PCBs  (118, 138, 153, 170, 180, and 187). Ridge regression (0.013, CI 0.001, 0.023;  26.0\% mediated) and models examining summative exposure scores with linear  combinations derived from principal components analysis (0.019, CI 0.009, 0.029;  34.8\% mediated) and Toxic Equivalency Quotient (TEQ) scores (0.016, CI 0.005,  0.026; 28.8\% mediated) showed significant IEs when incorporating survey weights.  Exposures to individual POPs and their mixtures, which may arise from residential  and occupational segregation, may help explain why Black Americans have longer  LTL than their White counterparts, providing an environmental explanation for  counterintuitive race differences in cellular aging.},

To our knowledge, no data are  available on relative telomere length (RTL) as a potential biomarker for  age-related diseases in a Lebanese population. The aim of this study was to  evaluate whether there is an association between RTL and demographic  characteristics, lifestyle habits and diseases in the Lebanese. This was a  cross-sectional study of 497 Lebanese subjects. Peripheral blood RTL was measured  by amplifying telomere and single copy gene using real-time PCR. Mean ± SD RTL  was 1.42 ± 0.83, and it was categorized into 3 tertiles. Older age (P=0.002) and  wider waist circumference (WC) (P=0.001) were statistically significantly  associated with shorter RTL. Multinomial logistic regression showed that subjects  who had some level of sleeping difficulty had a statistically significantly  shorter RTL when compared to those with no sleeping difficulties at all [OR (95\%  CI): 2.01 (1.11-3.62) in the first RTL tertile]. Importantly, statistically  significantly shorter RTL was found with every additional 10 cm of WC [OR (95\%  CI): 1.30 (1.11-1.52) for first RTL tertile]. In addition, and after performing  the multivariate logistic regression and adjusting for "predictors" of RTL, the  odds of having hypertension or being treated for hypertension were higher in  patients who had shorter RTL: OR (95\% CI): 2.45 (1.36-4.44) and 2.28 (1.22-4.26)  in the first RTL tertiles respectively with a similar trend, though not  statistically significant, in the second RTL tertiles. This is the first study in  Lebanon to show an association between age, central obesity, poor sleep and  hypertension and RTL. It is hoped that telomere length measurement be potentially  used as a biomarker for biological age and age-related diseases and progression  in the Lebanese.},

METHODS: We  conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,232 women from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey to examine maternal age at last birth and telomere  length, surveyed between 1999 and 2002. We included perimenopausal and  postmenopausal women age 40 years and older. Maternal age at last live birth was  self-reported, and leukocyte telomere length was measured using quantitative  polymerase chain reaction. We calculated least-squares geometric mean telomere  length across categories of maternal age adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, number  of live births, survey cycle, and history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy. P  trend {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For hypothesis-generation,  we explored modification by reproductive and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS:  Maternal age at last birth was positively associated with telomere length: the  multivariable-adjusted least-squares geometric mean leukocyte telomere length  across categories of age at last birth ({\textless}25, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, ≥40 y) was  0.90, 0.93, 0.93, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively (P trend = 0.04). There was  suggestive evidence this association may be restricted to those women with one or  two live births or women who reported ever using oral contraceptives (P  interaction {\textless}0.10 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Later maternal age was associated with  longer telomere length in a nationally representative population of women. These  data provide new insight into the biological relationship between reproductive  history and long-term health. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A662.},

METHODS: Conducted as a  cross-sectional investigation, the study enrolled 448 participants residing in an  urban area of a municipality in Brazil. Relative telomere length in blood samples  was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), whereas the  presence of anorexia of ageing was determined using the Simplified Appetite  Nutritional Questionnaire. Data analysis employed multiple logistic regression.  RESULTS: Among the 448 older individuals surveyed, 70.69\% were female, and the  predominant age bracket ranged from 60 to 69 years (45.08\%). Approximately 25\%  exhibited the shortest telomeric length, with a corresponding anorexia of ageing  prevalence of 41.16\%. Older individuals with diminished telomere lengths  displayed an increased likelihood of experiencing anorexia of ageing (odds ratio  [OR] = 1.92; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-3.29), independent of factors  such as gender, age group, depressive symptoms, pain and performance in basic  daily life activities.

A  total of 886 older adults ({\textgreater}55 years old; 645 males and 241 females) from the  Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort were included in the study. TL  was measured by monochrome multiplex real-time quantitative PCR. Age-adjusted TL  was used for all analyses. Dietary patterns were identified by PCA based on  thirty predefined candidate food groups collected from a validated 136-food items  frequency questionnaire. Generalised linear models were fitted to obtain  β-coefficients and their 95 \% CI evaluating differences in TL between each of the  four upper quintiles of adherence to dietary patterns and the lowest quintile.  Sensitivity analyses by rerunning all multiple linear models under different  stratifications were performed to evaluate the robustness of our results. Two  major dietary patterns were empirically identified, Western dietary pattern (WDP)  and Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP). After adjustment for potential  confounders, longer TL was found among subjects in the highest quintile of MDP (β  = 0·064; 95 \% CI 0·004, 0·123). The WDP showed no significant association with  TL. In conclusion, higher adherence to a posteriori-derived MDP was independently  associated with longer telomeres in an older adult Spanish population of the SUN  project.},

The principal components analysis was used to determine dietary  patterns and other demographic characteristics. Leukocyte telomere length (TL)  was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure  number of telomere repeat copy number (T) to the relative number of 36B4 copies  (S) (T/S ratio). T/S in office-workers, waste recyclers, and other workers were  1.22 ± 0.4, 1.08 ± 0.3, and 1.094 ± 0.34, respectively. The results of  multivariate linear regression adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), and  smoking were showed that whole grains (β = 0.02; p = .05), refined grains, fruits  and vegetables, fish and dairy products were associated with an increase in  log-T/S, but consumption of nuts and seeds (β = -0.00072; p = .06), meats (β =  -0.00043; p = .9), produced meats (β = -0.00238; p = .03), oils and solid fats (β  = -0.00146; p = .03) had a negative relationship with log-T/S in all studied  occupational classes. A positive relationship was reported between the healthy (β  = 0.017; p = .2) and traditional dietary pattern (β = 0.012; p = .4) with  log-T/S, but western pattern identified negative relationship (β = -0.004; p =  .7). Adherence to a healthy (with consumption whole grains, refined grains,  dairy, and cereals) and then traditional pattern with increased consumption of  fruits, vegetables and whole grains, fish and dairy products are necessary to  prevent TL destruction in all studied occupational classes.},

However, little is known about the impact of body iron  status on telomere length. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the association  between serum ferritin concentrations, an indicator of body iron status, and  leukocyte telomere length in US adults. DESIGN: We conducted a nationwide,  population-based, cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: We used data from  the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. We  included 7,336 adults aged 20 years or older who had available data on serum  ferritin levels and telomere length. High ferritin levels were defined as a serum  ferritin level {\textgreater}200 ng/mL (449.4 pmol/L) in women and {\textgreater}300 ng/mL (674.1 pmol/L)  in men. Low ferritin levels were defined as a serum ferritin level {\textless}30 ng/mL  (67.4 pmol/L). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Leukocyte telomere length was assayed using  the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Linear  regression with survey weights was performed to estimate the association between  serum ferritin levels and telomere length. RESULTS: The prevalence of adults with  high and low serum ferritin levels was 10.9\% and 17.6\%, respectively. High  ferritin levels were inversely associated with telomere length compared to normal  ferritin levels. After adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle  factors, body mass index, C-reactive protein, and leukocyte cell type  composition, the β coefficient for log-transformed telomere length was -0.020  (standard error [SE]=0.009; P=0.047). The association was stronger in adults aged  65 years or older (β coefficient -0.081, SE=0.017; P{\textless}0.001) than in adults 20 to  44 years old (β coefficient -0.023, SE=0.019; P=0.24) or adults aged 45 to 64  years old (β coefficient 0.024, SE=0.015; P=0.10) (P for interaction 0.003). Low  ferritin levels were not significantly associated with telomere length compared  with normal ferritin levels. CONCLUSIONS: In a US nationally representative  population, high body iron status was associated with shorter telomeres,  especially in adults aged 65 years or older.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary energy restriction in mammals, particularly at a young age, extends the life span. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is thought to be a  bioindicator of aging in humans. High n-6 (omega-6) PUFA intake may accelerate  LTL attrition. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether lower energy and higher PUFA  intakes in young adulthood are associated with shorter LTL in cross-sectional and  longitudinal analyses. DESIGN: In a longitudinal observational study (405 men,  204 women), diet was determined at baseline by a semiquantitative food-frequency  questionnaire, and LTL was determined by Southern blots at mean ages of 30.1 y  (baseline) and 43.2 y (follow-up). Spearman correlations and multivariable linear  regression were used. RESULTS: Baseline energy intake was inversely associated  with follow-up LTL in men (standardized β = -0.171, P = 0.0005) but not in women  (P = 0.039 for sex interaction). The difference in men between the highest and  lowest quintiles of energy was 244 base pairs (bp) (95\% CI: 59, 429 bp) and  between extreme quintiles of LTL was 440 kcal (95\% CI: 180, 700 kcal).  Multivariable adjustment modestly attenuated the association (β = -0.157, P =  0.002). Inverse associations, which were noted for all macronutrients, were  strongest for the unsaturated fatty acids. In multivariable models including  energy and the macronutrients (as percentage of energy), the significant inverse  energy-LTL association (but not the PUFA-LTL association) persisted. The  energy-LTL association was restricted to never smokers (standardized β = -0.259,  P = 0.0008; P = 0.050 for the smoking × calorie interaction). CONCLUSIONS: The  inverse calorie intake-LTL association is consistent with trial data showing  beneficial effects of calorie restriction on aging biomarkers. Further  exploration of energy intake and LTL dynamics in the young is needed.},

Data analyses used multivariable linear  regressions, while accounting for the survey design. RESULTS: A total of 5446  eligible participants, with 46.8\% (n = 2550) being men, were included. Their  average age was 47.1 years for the total sample, and 47.8 and 46.5 years in men  and women respectively (p = 0.085 for men vs. women difference). Concentrations  of palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid decreased with increasing length of  the telomere (p {\textless} 0.05). Univariable linear regressions revealed a significant  negative association between levels of the palmitelaidic acid, elaidic acid,  vaccenic acid, and linolelaidic acid with TL. However when models were adjusted  for age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status, sub-clinical inflammation,  body mass index, and smoking, only palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid  remained significant (p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: TFAs levels and particularly  palmitelaidic and linolelaidic acids, are likely negatively associated with  telomere lenght.

A lack of specific antioxidants is  believed to increase free radical damage and a greater risk for telomere  shortening. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between diet and leukocyte  telomere length in a cross-sectional study of children and adolescents. We  hypothesized that dietary total antioxidant capacity would be positively  associated with telomere length. METHODS: Telomere length was measured by  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 287 participants (55\% males,  6-18 years), who were randomly selected from the GENOI study. RESULTS: A positive  correlation between dietary total antioxidant capacity and telomere length (r =  0.157, p = 0.007) was found after adjustment for age and energy intake. However,  higher white bread consumption was associated with shorter telomeres (β = -0.204,  p = 0.002) in fully-adjusted models. Interestingly, those individuals who had  simultaneously higher dietary total antioxidant capacity and lower white bread  consumption significantly presented the longest telomeres. Moreover, the  multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for very short telomeres was 0.30 for dietary  total antioxidant capacity (p = 0.023) and 1.37 for white bread (p = 0.025).  CONCLUSION: It was concluded that longer telomeres were associated with higher  dietary total antioxidant capacity and lower white bread consumption in Spanish  children and adolescents.

AIMS:  To evaluate whether the combination of these two biomarkers would be a better  predictor of mortality than either alone. METHODS: This present study included  participants 60 years of age or older from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey in the 1999-2002 phase. The frailty phenotype was identified  based on the Fried definition. Telomere length relative to standard reference DNA  (T/S ratio) was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cox  proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the individual and  combined effects of frailty phenotype and telomere length on all-cause and  cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Compared with participants with neither  impairment, the mortality risks increased slightly among participants with short  telomere length only (hazard ratio [HR] 1.19, 95\% confidence interval [CI]:  1.00-1.42) or pre-frailty only (HR 2.16, 95\% CI 1.80-2.60) and gradually elevated  approximately 3 folds with both short telomere length and pre-frailty (HR 2.23,  95\% CI 1.81-2.74) or frailty (HR 3.57, 95\% CI 2.56-4.98). Moreover, participants  with both short telomere length and frailty had the highest increased all-cause  mortality (HR 5.16, 95\% CI 3.38-7.85) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 4.67, 95\%  CI 2.02-10.82). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The combined predictor had more  capability of predicting mortality, which suggested that integrating both  molecular biomarkers and physiological functional parameters would be a more  informative measure of biological aging.},

Methods: Data from  the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used  (N = 1868 adults 20+ years); analyzed in 2016. Sedentary behavior and MVPA were  subjectively assessed with cardiorespiratory fitness determined from a submaximal  treadmill-based test; participants were classified as above or below the median  values for each of these three parameters. A blood sample was obtained from each  participant to assess LTL via quantitative polymerase chain reaction, with  participants grouped into LTL tertiles. Results: Participants who engaged in  higher MVPA, sat less and had higher cardiorespiratory fitness had an increased  odds (ranging from 85\% to 105\%) of being in LTL tertile 3 (vs. 1). In an extended  adjusted multinomial logistic regression model, only MVPA was positively  associated with LTL (odds ration [OR] = 1.37; 95\% CI: 0.99-1.90; P = 0.05).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coffee is an important source of antioxidants, and consumption of this beverage is associated with many health conditions and a lower mortality  risk. However, no study, to our knowledge, has examined whether varying coffee or  caffeine consumption levels are associated with telomere length, a biomarker of  aging whose shortening can be accelerated by oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: We  performed a large comprehensive study on how coffee consumption is associated  with telomere length. METHODS: We used data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS),  a prospective cohort study of female nurses that began in 1976. We examined the  cross-sectional association between coffee consumption and telomere length in  4780 women from the NHS. Coffee consumption information was obtained from  validated food-frequency questionnaires, and relative telomere length was  measured in peripheral blood leukocytes by the quantitative real-time polymerase  chain reaction. Unconditional logistic regression was used to obtain ORs when the  telomere length outcome was dichotomized at the median. Linear regression was  used for tests of trend with coffee consumption and telomere length as continuous  variables. RESULTS: Higher total coffee consumption was significantly associated  with longer telomeres after potential confounding adjustment. Compared with  non-coffee drinkers, multivariable ORs for those drinking 2 to {\textless}3 and ≥3 cups of  coffee/d were, respectively, 1.29 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.68) and 1.36 (95\% CI: 1.04,  1.78) (P-trend = 0.02). We found a significant linear association between  caffeine consumption from all dietary sources and telomere length (P-trend =  0.02) after adjusting for potential confounders, but not after additionally  adjusting for total coffee consumption (P-trend = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: We found  that higher coffee consumption is associated with longer telomeres among female  nurses. Future studies are needed to better understand the influence of coffee  consumption on telomeres, which may uncover new knowledge of how coffee  consumption affects health and longevity.},

There is no research on associations  of the BTEXs mixture with telomere length (TL), a marker of cellular aging, in  the general population. METHODS: We analyzed a subsample of 549 US adults aged  20-59 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000.  BTEXs samples were collected by passive exposure badges worn by participants for  48-72 h. Levels of BTEXs were measured with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.  Leukocyte TL was measured with qPCR. We used Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression  (BKMR) to examine the effect of the BTEXs mixture on TL adjusting for potential  confounders. Analyses were stratified by tobacco smoking status (serum  cotinine≥10 ng/mL vs. {\textless}10 ng/mL). RESULTS: Levels of personal exposure to BTEXs  were detectable in most participants and were relatively higher in the 150  smokers than in the 399 nonsmokers. The BTEXs were moderately or strongly  intercorrelated (0.5 {\textless} r ≤ 0.9, P {\textless} 0.05). All chemicals had weak, inverse  correlations with TL (-0.1{\textless}r {\textless} 0, P {\textgreater} 0.05). In BKMR models among the nonsmokers,  the BTEXs mixture was significantly inversely associated with TL at a low range  of the BTEXs (20th-65th percentile) but was not associated with TL at a higher  range ({\textgreater}65th percentile). Also, we found a U-shape association of benzene and a  positive association of ethylbenzene with TL independent of other BTEXs. Among  smokers, neither the BTEXs mixture nor any individual BTEXs were significantly  associated with TL.

What remains  under-investigated, however, is whether there is a mode-specific association of  physical activity on leukocyte telomere length, which was this study's purpose.  METHODS: Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  were used (N=6474 adults analyzed). Leukocyte telomere length was assessed using  quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Physical activity was assessed via  self-report, with participants classified as meeting physical activity guidelines  (≥2000 metabolic equivalent of task-min-month) for 9 separate physical  activities, including aerobics (unweighted percent meeting guidelines: 2.98\%;  n=193), basketball (2.0\%; n=129), bicycling (3.71\%; n=240), dance (2.30\%; n=149),  running (3.09\%; n=200), stair climbing (1.33\%, n=86), swimming (1.85\%, n=120),  walking (13.53\%; n=876), and weight lifting (2.61\%; n=169). RESULTS: In a single  multivariable linear regression model including the independent variables of age,  gender, race-ethnicity, weight status, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein,  total metabolic equivalent of task-min-month of physical activity and the 9  binary meeting physical activity guideline variables, the only mode of physical  activity that was significantly associated with leukocyte telomere length was  meeting physical activity guidelines from running (β=0.06; 95\% CI: 0.01-0.11;  P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Running-specific physical activity was the only evaluated  physical activity associated with leukocyte telomere length, which may provide  one potential mechanism (i.e., leukocyte telomere length) through which  running-based physical activity may help to prevent cardiovascular disease and  premature mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary factors can affect telomere length (TL), a biomarker of aging, through oxidation and inflammation-related mechanisms. A Dietary  Inflammatory Index (DII) could help to understand the effect of the inflammatory  potential of the diet on telomere shortening. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to  determine the association of the DII with TL and to examine whether  diet-associated inflammation could modify the telomere attrition rate after a 5-y  follow-up of a Mediterranean dietary intervention. DESIGN: This was a prospective  study of 520 participants at high cardiovascular disease risk (mean ± SD age:  67.0 ± 6.0 y, 45\% males) from the PREDIMED-NAVARRA (PREvención con DIeta  MEDiterránea-NAVARRA) trial. Leukocyte TL was measured by quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction at baseline and after 5 y of follow-up. The DII was  calculated from self-reported data by using a validated 137-item food-frequency  questionnaire. RESULTS: Longer telomeres at baseline were found in participants  who had a more anti-inflammatory diet (lowest DII score) (P-trend = 0.012).  Longitudinal analyses further showed that a greater anti-inflammatory potential  of the diet (i.e., a decrease in the DII) could significantly slow down the rate  of telomere shortening. Moreover, the multivariable-adjusted OR for short  telomeres (z score ≤20th percentile) was 1.80 (95\% CI: 1.03, 3.17) in a  comparison between the highest (proinflammatory) and the lowest  (anti-inflammatory) DII tertiles. Similarly, a greater DII (greatest  proinflammatory values) after a 5-y follow-up was associated with almost a 2-fold  higher risk of accelerated telomere attrition compared with the highest decrease  in DII (greatest anti-inflammatory values) during this period (P-trend = 0.025).  CONCLUSIONS: This study showed both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations  between the inflammatory potential of the diet and telomere shortening in  subjects with a high cardiovascular disease risk. Our findings are consistent  with, but do not show, a beneficial effect of adherence to an anti-inflammatory  diet on aging and health by slowing down telomere shortening. These results  suggest that diet might play a key role as a determinant of TL through  proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

There are a limited number of empirical studies concerning  the effect of anthropometric parameters on telomere length.

The  primary outcomes of this study were to examine the potential relationships  between the anthropometric indices and the telomere length, while secondary  outcomes of this study was to investigate the association between different  anthropometric indices and mortality risk. A significant positive correlation was  noted between the mean telomere length and the thigh circumference (TC) and calf  circumference (CC) in all designed models. Participants in the highest TC and CC  quartiles tended to have a longer telomere length and lowered the hazards for  all-cause mortality to 43\% and 57\%, respectively. Notably, the anthropometric  indices involving the CC with higher values seemed to be surrogate markers for  the reduction of the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and malignancy-related  mortality (all P {\textless} 0.05).

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Short telomeres and B vitamin deficiencies have been proposed as risk factors for age-related diseases and mortality that interact through oxidative  stress and inflammation. However, available data to support this concept are  insufficient. We aimed to investigate the predictive role of B vitamins and  homocysteine (HCY) for mortality in cardiovascular patients. We explored  potential relationships between HCY, B vitamins, relative telomere length (RTL),  and indices of inflammation. METHODS: Vitamin B6, HCY, interleukin-6 (IL-6),  high-sensitive-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and RTL were measured in participants  of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study. Death events were  recorded over a median follow-up of 9.9 years. RESULTS: All-cause mortality  increased with higher concentrations of HCY and lower vitamin B6. Patients in the  4th quartile of HCY and vitamin B6 had hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality  of 2.77 (95\% CI 2.28-3.37) and 0.41(95\% CI 0.33-0.49), respectively, and for  cardiovascular mortality of 2.78 (95\% CI 2.29-3.39) and 0.40 (95\% CI 0.33-0.49),  respectively, compared to those in the 1st quartile. Multiple adjustments for  confounders did not change these results. HCY and vitamin B6 correlated with  age-corrected RTL (r = - 0.086, p {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.04, p = 0.031, respectively),  IL-6 (r = 0.148, p {\textless} 0.001; r = - 0.249, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively), and hs-CRP  (r = 0.101, p {\textless} 0.001; r = - 0.320, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Subjects with the  longest telomeres had a significantly higher concentration of vitamin B6, but  lower concentrations of HCY, IL-6, and hs-CRP. Multiple regression analyses  identified HCY as an independent negative predictor of age-corrected RTL.  CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin B6 deficiency are  risk factors for death from any cause. Hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin B6  deficiency correlate with increased mortality. This correlation might, at least  partially, be explained by accelerated telomere shortening induced by oxidative  stress and systemic inflammation in these circumstances.},

We performed a cross sectional analysis into  the associations of smoking indicators with leukocyte telomere length (LTL) by  race among 5864 nationally representative sample of US adults (≥20 years). Data  from 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was used for  the analysis. Smoking indicators were assessed by interviews and serum cotinine  levels. LTL was quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Multiple linear  regressions were used to assess the association with adjustment for covariates,  sample weights and design effects separately for Whites, Blacks and Mexican  Americans. The intensity of smoking, measured by the average number of cigarettes  consumed per day, was negatively associated with LTL among Whites (β: -3.87, 95\%  CI: -5.98 to -1.21) and among Blacks (β: -15.46, 95\% CI: -29.79 to -2.12)  participants. Compared with cotinine level {\textless} 0.05 ng/ml, cotinine level ≥3 ng/ml  was associated with shorter LTL (β: -77.92, 95\% CI = -143.05 to -11.70) among  Whites, but not among Blacks. We found increased number of cigarette consumption  to be associated with shorter LTL in both Blacks and Whites, indicating that the  impact of smoking on life-shortening diseases could partly be explained by  telomere biology. Increased cotinine concentration however, was associated with  shorter LTL only among Whites, not among Blacks. This differential relationship  that we observed may have implications in interpreting cotinine as an objective  biomarker of smoking exposure across races and warrant additional prospective  investigation.},

We used  nationally-representative datasets from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate if CD autoimmunity in older adults  (age≥50years) is associated with shorter LTL. RESULTS: Our study included 3939  subjects, where 25 subjects (mean age 65years) were CD seropositive and 3914  (mean age 64years) were CD seronegative. CD seropositive subjects had shorter LTL  than CD seronegative subjects (P{\textless}0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: In a  nationally-representative population of adults age≥50years, CD seropositivity is  significantly associated with shorter LTL, independently of age, sex,  race/ethnicity, serum ferritin and folate, and socioeconomic status.

Many factors can modify  telomere length, among them are: nutrition and smoking habits, physical  activities and socioeconomic status measured by education level. The aim of the  study was to determine the influence of above mentioned factors on peripheral  blood mononuclear cells telomere length. METHODS: Study included 28 subjects  (seven male and 21 female, age 18-65 years.), smokers and non-smokers without any  serious health problems in past and present. Following a basic medical  examination, patients completed the food frequency questionnaire with 17 foods  and beverages most common groups and gave blood for testing. PBMC telomere length  were measured with qualitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) method  and expressed as a T/S ratio. RESULTS: Among nine food types (cereal, fruits,  vegetables, diary, red meat, poultry, fish, sweets and salty snacks) and eight  beverages (juices, coffee, tea, mineral water, alcoholic- and sweetened  carbonated beverages) only intake of red meat was related to T/S ratio.  Individuals with increased consumption of red meat have had higher T/S ratio and  the strongest significant differences were observed between consumer groups:  "never" and "1-2 daily" (p = 0.02). Smoking habits, physical activity, LDL and  HDL concentrations, and education level were not related to telomere length,  directly or as a covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Unexpected correlation of telomere  length with the frequency of consumption of red meat indicates the need for  further in-depth research and may undermine some accepted concepts of adverse  effects of this diet on the health status and life longevity.},

The ln-transformed blood lead and cadmium  concentrations were associated with shorter LTL. LTL was inversely related to  hypertension and the OR was 0.65 (95\% CI: 0.47 to 0.89).

In this study, we aimed at determining the association  between dietary patterns or consumption of specific foods and LTL in Korean  adults. SUBJECT/METHODS: A total of 1958 middle-aged and older Korean adults from  a population-based cohort were included in the study. Dietary data were collected  from a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline (June 2001 to  January 2003). LTL was assessed using real-time PCR during the 10-year follow-up  period (February 2011 to November 2012). RESULTS: We identified two major factors  and generated factor scores using factor analysis. The first factor labeled  'prudent dietary pattern' was characterized by high intake of whole grains,  seafood, legumes, vegetables and seaweed, whereas the second factor labeled  'Western dietary pattern' was characterized by high intake of refined grain, red  meat or processed meat and sweetened carbonated beverages. In a multiple linear  regression model adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and other potential  confounding variables, the prudent dietary pattern was positively associated with  LTL. In the analysis of particular food items, higher consumption of legumes,  nuts, seaweed, fruits and dairy products and lower consumption of red meat or  processed meat and sweetened carbonated beverages were associated with longer  LTL. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diet in the remote past, that is, 10  years earlier, may affect the degree of biological aging in middle-aged and older  adults.},

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002, representative of the  noninstitutionalized U.S. POPULATION: The analytic study population included 3496  men and women aged 40-84 years without a history of cancer and who had  information of telomere length and statin use. RESULTS: Compared with nonusers,  statin users were more likely to be former smokers, older, white, male, and had  more comorbidities. Statin users did not have longer telomeres than nonusers  after age (coefficient -0.013, p = .30) and multivariable (0.0003, p = .98)  adjustment. After multivariable adjustment, log-transformed telomere length  nonstatistically significantly increased with increasing duration of use (0.003,  p-trend = .11), which did not differ by number of comorbidities (p-interaction =  0.18). Compared with nonuse, more than 5 years of use had an odds ratio of  telomere length above the 75th percentile of 1.62 (95\% confidence interval  0.90-2.92; p-trend = .10). CONCLUSIONS: Although telomere length appeared to be  longer with longer duration of use of a statin, this association was not  statistically significant, and we could not rule out bias as the explanation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a putative biological marker of immune system age, and there are demonstrated associations between LTL and  cardiovascular disease. This may be due in part to the relationship of LTL with  other biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease risk. However, the  strength of associations between LTL and adiposity, metabolic, proinflammatory,  and cardiovascular biomarkers has not been systematically evaluated in a United  States nationally representative population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined  associations between LTL and 17 cardiovascular biomarkers, including  lipoproteins, blood sugar, circulatory pressure, proinflammatory markers, kidney  function, and adiposity measures, in adults ages 20 to 84 from the  cross-sectional US nationally representative 1999-2002 National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (n = 7,252), statistically adjusting for  immune cell type distributions. We also examine whether these associations  differed systematically by age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, and income. We  found that a one unit difference in the following biomarkers were associated with  kilobase pair differences in LTL: BMI -0.00478 (95\% CI -0.00749--0.00206), waist  circumference -0.00211 (95\% CI -0.00325--0.000969), percentage of body fat  -0.00516 (95\% CI -0.00761--0.0027), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol  0.00179 (95\% CI 0.000571-0.00301), triglycerides -0.000285 (95\% CI  -0.000555--0.0000158), pulse rate -0.00194 (95\% CI -0.00317--0.000705),  C-reactive protein -0.0363 (95\% CI 0.0601--0.0124), cystatin C -0.0391 (95\% CI  -0.0772--0.00107). When using clinical cut-points we additionally found  associations between LTL and insulin resistance -0.0412 (95\% CI -0.0685--0.0139),  systolic blood pressure 0.0455 (95\% CI 0.00137-0.0897), and diastolic blood  pressure -0.0674 (95\% CI -0.126--0.00889). These associations were 10\%-15\%  greater without controlling for leukocyte cell types. There were very few  differences in the associations by age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, or  income. Our findings are relevant to the relationships between these  cardiovascular biomarkers in the general population but not to cardiovascular  disease as a clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: LTL is most strongly associated with  adiposity, but is also associated with biomarkers across several physiological  systems. LTL may thus be a predictor of cardiovascular disease through its  association with multiple risk factors that are physiologically correlated with  risk for development of cardiovascular disease. Our results are consistent with  LTL being a biomarker of cardiovascular aging through established physiological  mechanisms.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Higher vitamin D levels and longer telomere length (TL) have been associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases and all-cause mortality.  However, direct relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and TL  are not well established. Vitamin D could influence TL through its  anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to assess the relationship between  vitamin D levels and TL in US adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants of the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with data available on  25(OH)D and TL measures from 2001 to 2002 were included. 25(OH)D levels were  measured by the DiaSorin Radioimmunoassay. We used multivariable-adjusted linear  regression models, accounting for the survey design and sample weights. RESULTS:  Of the 4347 eligible participants, 47.0\% (n = 2045) were men. The mean age was  42.7 years overall, 49.2 years in men and 42.5 years in women (p = 0.060). After  adjustment for age, race, marital status, education, and C-reactive protein, each  1 ng/ml higher 25(OH)D level was associated with a 0.045 (95\% confidence interval  (CI): 0.032 to 0.059) longer telomere-to-single copy gene (T/S) ratio. This was  driven by a significant association in women (0.054 (0.043 to 0.064)) and in men  (0.036 (0.020 to 0.052)). However, after we further adjusted for smoking, body  mass index, and physical activity, no significant relation was found in the  overall sample (β coefficient -0.026, 95\% CI: -3.16, 1.67), for men (-0.016  (-3.72, 2.64)), or for women (-0.052 (-6.85, 2.26)). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  support a possible positive association between 25(OH)D levels and telomere  length. The implications of this association deserve further investigation.},

METHODS: Cross-sectional data on  7826 adults with a TL measurement, were included from the National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey, years 1999-2002. The population rate of decline in  TL across 10-year age categories was estimated using crude and adjusted  regression. RESULTS: In an adjusted model, the population rate of decline in TL  with age was consistent and linear for only three age categories: 20-29 (β =  -0.0172, 95\% CI: -0.0342, -0.0002), 50-59 (β = -0.0182, 95\% CI: -0.0311, -0.0054)  and 70-79 (β = -0.0170, 95\% CI: -0.0329, -0.0011) years. The population rate of  decline in TL with age was significantly greater for males and those with high  allostatic load and a history of comorbidities. When the population rate of  decline in TL was analyzed by gender in 10-year age bins, a fairly consistent yet  statistically non-significant decline for males was observed; however, a trough  in the rate was observed for females in the age categories 20-29 years (β =  -0.0284, 95\% CI: -0.0464, -0.0103) and 50-59 years (β = -0.0211, 95\% CI: -0.0391,  -0.0032). To further elucidate the gender difference observed in the primary  analyses, secondary analyses were conducted with reproductive and hormonal  status; a significant inverse association was found between TL and parity,  menopause, and age at menopause. CONCLUSIONS: TL was shorter with increasing age  and this decline was modified by gender, chronic stress and comorbidities;  individuals with chronic morbidity and/or chronic stress and females in their  twenties and fifties experienced greater decline. Female reproductive factors,  i.e., parity and menopause, were associated with TL.},

The association between telomere  length (TL), a biological index of ageing, and FH has not been hitherto  investigated. We addressed this question using data from the US National Health  and Education National Surveys (NHANES, 1999-2002). METHODS AND RESULTS: We  included individuals, who had TL measurements (with quantitative polymerase chain  reaction method) and a phenotypic diagnosis of FH based on the Dutch Lipid Clinic  Network (DLCN) criteria. Sample weights were applied for unequal probabilities of  selection, non-response bias, and oversampling by complex sample analysis. The  adult prevalence of FH in NHANES was 0.43\% [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)  0.33-0.57]. The frequencies of probable FH (mean DLCN score: 6.2) and definite FH  (mean DLCN score: 8.9) were 0.42\% (95\% CI 0.32-0.48) and 0.03\% (95\% CI  0.02-0.06), respectively. Subjects with FH had a higher prevalence of  non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes 2 type, and obesity) and early  atherosclerosis (2.9\% in overall population vs. 42.2\% in FH). Overall, the mean  TL in the non-FH population was 1.09 (95\% CI 1.06-1.12) (T/S ratio) and 1.09 (95\%  CI 1.03-1.12) [(T/S ratio) for total FH]. Telomere length adjusted for age, sex,  race, and body mass index was shorter in FH compared with healthy subjects (FH  0.89, 95\% CI 0.84-0.93 vs. healthy: 1.05, 95\% CI 0.97-1.11 T/S ratio; P {\textless} 0.001).  Subjects with longer TL (highest quartile) had 12\% less chance of having FH  compared with those with TL in the lowest quartile (Q1, 95\% CI 0.78-0.93).  CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest an association between TL, an index  of biological age, and the presence of FH, the most common inherited cause of  premature ASCVD.

Telomere length may represent one important mechanism by which dietary intake  influences risk of age-related diseases; however, it is unknown which diet  pattern is most strongly related to telomere length. We compared the  relationships between 4 evidence-based diet quality indices and leukocyte  telomere length in a nationally representative sample of healthy adults, and the  extent to which these associations differed between men and women. Data on 4,758  adults aged 20-65 years with no prior diagnosis of major chronic disease were  obtained from the 1999-2002 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey.

METHODS: This study was based on the 2001-2002 U.S. National Health  and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A subsample of 1,127 men aged 40-85  years without prior history of prostate cancer who provided informed consent and  blood samples were selected. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) relative to standard  DNA reference (T/S ratio) was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Survey-weighted multivariable linear regression was performed to examine T/S  ratio across quintiles of total and free PSA and free-to-total PSA ratio (\%fPSA).  A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding men dying from prostate cancer  during follow-up through to December 31, 2006. Stratification analyses were  carried out to assess any effect modification by age group, race, body mass index  (BMI), and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation. RESULTS:  Higher total PSA levels were associated to longer LTL, with approximately 8\%  increase in log-transformed T/S ratio (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2-13\%) among  men in the highest quintile of total PSA compared to the lowest in the fully  adjusted model (P(trend)  = 0.01). No significant association was found for free  PSA or \%fPSA, although nonlinearity between all PSA measures and T/S ratio was  indicated. Similar results were found after excluding men who died from prostate  cancer during follow-up. We also found the associations between total PSA and T/S  ratio to be strongest among non-Hispanic blacks, non-obese men (BMI {\textless}30 kg/m(2)  ), and those with low CRP. However, a significant interaction was only found  between total PSA and race/ethnicity (P(interaction)  = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Total  PSA levels were strongly associated to LTL, particularly among non-Hispanic  blacks.

All statistical analyses accounted for the  survey design and sample weights. RESULTS    Of the 10 568 eligible participants,  48.0\% (n = 5020) were men; the mean age was 44.1 years. Mean (adjusted for sex,  age, and race) dietary intakes of carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total folate,  vitamin B6, magnesium, iron, copper, polyunsaturated fatty acids 22:5, and  vitamin C monotonically increased across TL quarters (P {\textless}0.05 for all), while  total fat and caffeine decreased across TL quarters (P {\textless}0.05 for all). Three food  patterns together explaining 56.8\% of the variance of the dietary nutrient  consumption were identified.

DATA SOURCES: Our study population included  3202 participants aged 50 to 84 years from National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey 1999 to 2001. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional Study. LTLs  between people with and without a usual source of care were compared using  unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models. Fully adjusted models accounted  for demographic characteristics, health conditions, and health behaviors.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After controlling for individual factors, health conditions,  and health behaviors, people who had a usual source of health care had  significantly longer LTL (β = 89.8 base pairs, P-value = .005) compared with  those without a usual source of care; corresponding to approximately 7 years of  life. CONCLUSIONS: Having a usual source of health care is associated with longer  LTL among older adults. This study provides a potential biologic link for the  noted association between primary care access and reduced mortality that has been  observed at the individual and population level.},

Research  demonstrates that lower extremity muscular strength is associated with mobility,  morbidity and mortality; however, no study, to our knowledge, had examined the  association between lower extremity muscular strength and LTL, which was the  purpose of this brief study. METHODS: Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES was used (N  = 2410; 50-85 years). Peak isokinetic knee extensor strength (IKES) was  objectively measured with LTL assessed from a blood sample. RESULTS: After  adjustments, for every 50 N increase in IKES, participants had a 9\% reduced odds  (P = .04) of being in the 1st (vs. 4th) LTL quartile. DISCUSSION: Lower extremity  muscular strength is associated with LTL, suggesting a possible mechanism through  which lower extremity muscular strength may be associated with morbidity and  mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Sarcopenia is common in patients with liver disease and both sarcopenia and short telomeres are associated with mortality, however their  relationship in patients with liver disease remains unknown. METHODS: A cohort of  16,072 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999  to 2006 was analyzed. Liver disease was defined by aminotransferases and  classified into etiology-based categories. Sarcopenia was defined by dual-energy  x-ray absorptiometry. All analyses were conducted separately on each multiple  imputation data set and combined via Rubin's rules. P-values for group  comparisons were calculated by testing logistic regression parameter estimates.  Cox proportional hazards regression was used for mortality analysis with  mortality data available until 2015. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was present in 9.5\% of  patients with liver disease. Age, race, income, education, physical inactivity,  and certain medical comorbidities were associated with sarcopenia. Patients with  liver disease and sarcopenia had significantly shorter telomeres than patients  with liver disease without sarcopenia when unadjusted for age. The interaction  between telomere length and sarcopenia was significantly associated with  all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of telomere length on  all-cause mortality in patients with liver disease varied by age and sarcopenia  status. Shorter telomeres appear to be more highly associated with increased  mortality in older patients without sarcopenia.},

Both telomere length and  hypertension risk can be modified by certain dietary factors, such as fruit and  vegetables. This study was to examine the potential effect of these dietary  factors on the association between telomere length and hypertension risk. STUDY  DESIGN: A community-based case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: 271 hypertensive  patients and 455 normotensive controls aged 40-70 years and living in Yinzhou,  Zhejiang Province, China. OUTCOME MEASURES: Peripheral leucocyte relative  telomere length (RTL) was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Dietary  intake was assessed by a brief semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The  association between RTL and hypertension risk was analysed using logistic  regression, and the modulatory effect of dietary intake on RTL-related  hypertension risk was analysed using likelihood ratio tests. RESULTS: Among  controls, longer age-adjusted RTL was associated with higher vegetable intake  (p=0.01). Individuals with longer age-adjusted RTL (based on median value) were  30\% less likely to have hypertension (OR=0.70, 95\% CI 0.52 to 0.96; p=0.03). The  observed RTL-hypertension relationship appeared to be modified by vegetable  intake-longer RTL was significantly associated with lower hypertension risk only  in those with greater vegetable consumption (OR=0.28, 95\% CI 0.14 to 0.57;  p{\textless}0.001), but not in those with lower vegetable intake (P-interaction=0.008).

METHODS: We  examined cross-sectional associations between the consumption of SSBs, diet soda,  and fruit juice and telomere length in a nationally representative sample of  healthy adults. The study population included 5309 US adults, aged 20 to 65  years, with no history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, from the 1999 to  2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Leukocyte telomere length  was assayed from DNA specimens. Diet was assessed using 24-hour dietary recalls.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Telomeres, DNA-protein structures that cap and protect chromosomes, are thought to shorten more rapidly when exposed to chronic inflammation and  oxidative stress. Diet and nutritional status may be a source of inflammation and  oxidative stress. However, relationships between telomere length (TL) and diet or  adiposity have primarily been studied cross-sectionally among older,  overweight/obese populations and yielded inconsistent results. Little is known  about the relationship between diet or body composition and TL among younger,  low- to normal-weight populations. It also remains unclear how cumulative  exposure to a specific diet or body composition during the years of growth and  development, when telomere attrition is most rapid, may be related to TL in  adulthood. METHODS: In a sample of 1459 young adult Filipinos, we assessed the  relationship between blood TL at ages 20.8-22.5 and measures of BMI z-score,  waist circumference, and diet collected between the ages of 8.5 and 22.5. TL was  measured using monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR, and diet was measured using  multiple 24-h recalls. RESULTS: We found no associations between blood TL and any  of the measures of adiposity or between blood TL and the seven dietary factors  examined: processed meats, fried/grilled meats and fish, non-fried fish, coconut  oil, fruits and vegetables, bread and bread products, and sugar-sweetened  beverages. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the inconsistencies in the literature and our  null results, small differences in body composition and consumption of any single  pro- or anti-inflammatory dietary component may not by themselves have a  meaningful impact on telomere integrity, or the impact may differ across distinct  ecological circumstances.},

Little is known about the biological mechanism by which deprived  neighborhood conditions exert negative influences on health. Data from the  1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were used to  assess the relationship between neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) and  log-transformed leukocyte telomere length (LTL) via multilevel modeling to  control for census tract level clustering. Models were constructed using tertiles  of NDI (ref = low NDI). NDI was calculated using census tract level socioeconomic  indicators from the 2000 U.S. Census. The sample (n = 5,106 adults) was 49.8\%  female and consisted of 82.9\% non-Hispanic whites, 9.4\% non-Hispanic blacks, and  7.6\% Mexican Americans. Mean age was 45.8 years. Residents of neighborhoods with  high NDI were younger, non-white, had lower educational attainment, and had a  lower poverty to income ratio (all p {\textless} 0.0001). Neighborhood deprivation was  inversely associated with LTL among individuals living in neighborhoods with  medium NDI (β = -0.043, SE = 0.012, p = 0.0005) and high NDI (β = -0.039,  SE = 0.013, p = 0.003).

Among women, only medium NDI (β = -0.020, SE = 0.016, p = 0.009) was  associated with shorter LTL. After controlling for individual characteristics,  including individual-level socioeconomic status, increasing neighborhood  socioeconomic deprivation is associated with shorter LTL among a nationally  representative sample of US adults. This suggests that telomere shortening may be  a mechanism through which neighborhood deprivation results in poor health  outcomes.},

Little is known about the mediation effect of lifestyle  factors associated with the relationship between obesity and telomere length. Our  objective was to examine this association in the US. Pack years smoked, drinking  level per day, physical activity (PA) per week and diet based on Healthy Eating  Index (HEI) were assessed as mediators associated with the relationship between  adiposity measures and leukocyte telomere length (LTL); adiposity measures  included body mass index (BMI), \% total body fat (TBF) and waist circumference  (WC).

Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortening is associated with aging  and is a hallmark of genomic instability and carcinogenesis.Objective: We aimed  to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]  concentrations and LTL in the general US population.Methods: We analyzed data  from the US NHANES 2001-2002. The study population comprised 1542 younger adults  (aged 20-39 y), 1336 middle-aged adults (aged 40-59 y), and 1382 older adults  (aged ≥60 y). LTL was measured by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Serum 25(OH)D concentrations ≥50 nmol/L were considered optimal. Linear  regression, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), total  energy and sugar intakes, calcium intake, socioeconomic status, milk and dietary  supplement consumption, and physical activity, was applied to investigate the  association between serum 25(OH)D and LTL.Results: In the total population, age,  sex, BMI, and non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity were significant predictors of  LTL. In the participants aged 40-59 y, an increment in serum 25(OH)D of 10 nmol/L  was associated with a 0.03- ± 0.01-kbp longer LTL, adjusted for age, sex,  race/ethnicity, and other factors (P = 0.001).

Aim: This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the  relationship between creatine consumption and various carcinogenic biomarkers in  blood and urine among individuals aged 18 years and older, utilizing data from  the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods:  Daily creatine intake was assessed using the Dietary Data databases, which were  compiled from individual in-person 24-h food recall interviews. The  concentrations of carcinogenic compounds (heterocyclic amines, acrylamide, and  formaldehyde) were extracted from NHANES 2013-2014 Laboratory Data database.  Results: The final analysis included 1763 adult respondents, of whom 907 (51.4\%)  were female. The mean daily creatine intake was 0.83 ± 0.77 grams (95\% CI, from  0.80 to 0.87). Regression analysis revealed no significant relationship between  daily creatine intake and most carcinogenic biomarkers, except for a significant  correlation (Model 1) between creatine intake and acrylamide levels (B = -3.999,  ß = -0.088, p = 0.05). Model 2 (demographics) confirmed a significant  relationship between daily creatine intake and circulating acrylamide  (B = -3.490, ß = -0.077, p = 0.02), as well as for blood levels of glycidamide  (B = -2.992, ß = -0.068, p = 0.05) and urinary  2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (B = 0.190, ß = 0.088, p = 0.03).  However, no correlation between creatine consumption and any carcinogenic  biomarkers remained significant after adjusting for nutritional factors (Model 3)  (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, the consumption of dietary creatine may be  considered safe and not associated with increased levels of above carcinogens in  the general population.},

	abstract = {Folate and vitamin B(12) are essential for a variety of metabolic processes. Both micronutrients have been shown to reduce oxidative stress significantly. The  present cross-sectional investigation evaluated the association between serum and  dietary folate and vitamin B(12) levels and leukocyte telomere length, an index  of cellular aging influenced by oxidative stress. The study included 5581 adults  from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Because  participants were randomly selected, results are generalizable to all civilian,  noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. A blood draw provided DNA and serum folate and  B(12) information. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to  measure telomere length. The Bio-Rad Quantaphase II folate and vitamin B(12)  radioassay kit was used to quantify levels of folate and vitamin B(12). Dietary  folate and vitamin B(12) were assessed using a multipass 24 h recall. In some  models, age, race, smoking pack-years, alcohol use, body mass index, total  physical activity, hours fasted before the blood draw, and diabetes status were  employed as covariates to minimize their influence. Findings showed that for each  additional year of chronological age, telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter, on  average (F = 378.8, p {\textless} 0.0001). Men had shorter telomeres than women after  adjusting for all the covariates (F = 6.8, p = 0.0146). Serum (F = 10.5, p =  0.0030) and dietary (F = 5.0, p = 0.0325) folate concentrations were each  linearly related to telomere length in women, but not in men, after controlling  for age and race. Serum vitamin B(12) and telomere length had a nonsignificant,  inverse relationship in women, with age and race controlled (F = 2.8, p =  0.1056), but no relation in men. Dietary vitamin B(12) was linearly related to  telomere length in women, after adjusting for age and race (F = 4.3, p = 0.0468),  but not in men. Overall, evidence indicates that folate and vitamin B(12) levels,  especially folate, account for meaningful differences in cell aging in women, but  not in men.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore influence of carbohydrates/fat proportions, dietary ingredients on telomere length shortening, oxidative stress and inflammation in a  Chinese population with different glucose tolerance status. METHODS: Five hundred  and fifty-six Chinese subjects without diabetes history underwent a 75 g, 2 h  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Subjects with diabetes (n = 159),  pre-diabetes (n = 197), and normal glucose tolerance (n = 200) were screened.  Dietary intakes were evaluated using a semi-quantitative food frequency  questionnaire (FFQ). Peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was  assessed using a real-time PCR assay. Blood lipid profile, levels of the  oxidative stress indicators superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase  (GR), 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) and inflammation indicators tumor  necrosis factor (TNF-ɑ), interleukine-6 (IL-6) were measured. Levels of HbA1c,  plasma glucose, insulin, and C peptide were also determined. Measurements were  taken at 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min after 75 g OGTT. Insulin sensitivity  was evaluated by HOMA-IR. Basal insulin secretion index (HOMA-β), early phase  disposition index (DI30) and total phase disposition index (DI120) indicate  insulin levels at different phases of insulin secretion. RESULTS: In patients  with newly diagnosed diabetes, LTL adjusted by age was longer in HbA1c {\textless} 7 \%  group (log (LTL):1.93 ± 0.25) than in HbA1c ≥ 7 \% group (log (LTL):1.82 ± 0.29).  LTL was not associated with daily energy intake, diet fat, carbohydrates and  protein proportions. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that legumes,  nuts, fish and seaweeds were protective factors for LTL shortening, and sweetened  carbonated beverage was a risk factor for LTL shortening ( legumes: β = 0.105, p  = 0.018; nuts: β = 0.110, p = 0.011; fish: β = 0.118, p = 0.007; seaweeds: β =  0.116, p = 0.009; sweetened carbonated beverage: β = -0.120, p = 0.004 ). Daily  energy intake was positively associated with TNF-ɑ, IL-6 (TNF-ɑ: r = 0.125, p =  0.006;IL-6: r = 0.092, p =0.04). Fat, carbohydrate proportions were positively  associated with TNF-ɑ (fat: r = 0.119, p = 0.008 ; carbohydrate: r = 0.094, p =  0.043). Seaweeds and dairy intake were negatively associated with 8-oxo-dG  (seaweed: r = -0.496, p = 0.001;dairy: r = -0.246, p = 0.046 ), vegetables and  fruits were positively associated with GR ( vegetables: r = 0.101, p =  0.034;fruits: r = 0.125, p = 0.045). Cereal, meat were positively associated with  TNF-ɑ ( cereal: r = 0.091, p = 0.048 ; meat: r = 0.405, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION:  Diabetes patients with better plasma glucose (HbA1c {\textless} 7 \%) had longer LTL, LTL  could reflect plasma glucose status in diabetes patients. LTL were probably not  influenced by diet carbohydrates/fat proportions but was associated with diet  ingredients. Diet ingredients significantly impacted on markers of inflammation  and oxidative stress, which probably had an effect on LTL.},

In experimental studies, they have been shown to induce  telomere shortening, but no epidemiologic study to date has examined their  associations with LTL in the general population. We examined associations of  blood lead and cadmium (n = 6,796) and urine cadmium (n = 2,093) levels with LTL  among a nationally representative sample of US adults from the National Health  and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002). The study population geometric mean  concentrations were 1.67 µg/dL (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.63, 1.70) for  blood lead, 0.44 µg/L (95\% CI: 0.42, 0.47) for blood cadmium, and 0.28 µg/L (95\%  CI: 0.27, 0.30) for urine cadmium. After adjustment for potential confounders,  the highest (versus lowest) quartiles of blood and urine cadmium were associated  with -5.54\% (95\% CI: -8.70, -2.37) and -4.50\% (95\% CI: -8.79, -0.20) shorter  LTLs, respectively, with evidence of dose-response relationship (P for trend {\textless}  0.05). There was no association between blood lead concentration and LTL. These  findings provide further evidence of physiological impacts of cadmium at  environmental levels and might provide insight into biological pathways  underlying cadmium toxicity and chronic disease risks.},

Higher exposure to cadmium  may be associated with shorter LTL, and adequate nutrient concentrations may be  associated with longer LTL; however, the potential interaction between metals and  nutrients on LTL has yet to be examined.Objectives: The objective of this study  was to evaluate whether serum concentrations of vitamins and carotenoids were  associated with LTL, and whether they modified the association between blood  cadmium and LTL in the US NHANES (1999-2002).Methods: We evaluated  cross-sectional associations between LTL and serum concentrations of vitamin A,  γ-tocopherol, α-tocopherol, folate, and vitamin B-12 (1999-2002; n = 7458) and  α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein + zeaxanthin, and lycopene  (2001-2002; n = 4018) in a nationally representative sample of US adults (≥20 y  of age) with the use of multivariable linear regression. We further investigated  whether vitamin and carotenoid concentrations modified associations between blood  cadmium and LTL with models stratified by serum nutrient concentrations and the  inclusion of an interaction term.Results: Blood cadmium was inversely associated  with LTL (percentage of LTL difference per 1 μg/L = -3.74; 95\% CI: -5.35, -2.10).  Serum vitamin A was positively associated (percentage of LTL difference per 1  μg/L = 4.01; 95\% CI: 0.26, 7.90) and γ-tocopherol was inversely associated  (percentage of LTL difference per 1 μg/dL = -2.49; 95\% CI: -4.21, -0.73) with  LTL. Serum folate (P-trend = 0.06) and α-tocopherol (P-trend = 0.10) were  marginally positively associated with LTL, whereas vitamin B-12 (P-trend = 0.78)  was not associated with LTL. Serum carotenoids were generally positively  associated with LTL. Serum vitamin and carotenoid concentrations did not modify  blood cadmium and LTL associations (P-interaction {\textgreater} 0.10).Conclusions: Results  from this cross-sectional study suggest that exposure to cadmium and certain  nutrients may be associated with LTL in US adults, but the serum concentrations  of the vitamins and carotenoids evaluated did not modify cross-sectional  associations between cadmium exposure and LTL.},

Aim: This cross-sectional study aims to examine the association between creatine  consumption and sleep habits and disorders among individuals aged 16 years and  older, using data from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES). Methods: The analysis included 5988 individuals (50.5\% females)  with a mean age of 47.4 ± 19.5 years. Daily creatine intake was assessed through  individual in-person 24-h food recall interviews, categorizing respondents into  two groups: those with suboptimal creatine intake ({\textless}1.00 g per day) and those  meeting recommended intake (dietary creatine ≥ 1.00 g per day). Sleep was  evaluated during household interviews using questions on sleep habits and  disorders from the NHANES Sleep Disorders component. Results: The average daily  creatine intake among participants was 0.88 ± 0.85 g (95\% CI, 0.86 to 0.90),  while the mean nightly sleep duration was 6.8 ± 1.5 h (95\% CI, 6.8 to 6.9).  Additionally, 1331 respondents (22.2\%) reported consulting a doctor or health  professional for sleep-related issues. Participants with suboptimal creatine  intake had a significantly higher prevalence of trouble sleeping compared to  those consuming recommended amounts (23.7\% vs 19.3\%; P {\textless} 0.01), with an odds  ratio of 1.30 (95\% CI: 1.13 to 1.48) for experiencing sleep disturbances.  However, the prevalence of more severe sleep disorders did not differ  significantly between the two creatine sub-populations (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion:  Our findings suggest that participants meeting recommended creatine intake levels  had a reduced risk of experiencing mild sleeping difficulties. These findings may  serve as a basis for future interventional studies aimed at validating and  confirming the potential benefits of dietary creatine in the field of sleep  medicine.},

Short leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a hallmark characteristic of aging, but LTL is also  associated with morbidity and mortality independent of age.

The  purpose of this study was to examine the association between screen-based  sedentary behavior and LTL. Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey were used (N=6405; age, 20-84 years). Leisure-time  screen-based sedentary behavior (television, video games, computer use) was  assessed via questionnaire, and LTL was extracted from DNA in whole blood with  the LTL assay performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. After  adjustments (including age and physical activity), for every 1-hour increase in  leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior, participants had a 7\% increased  odds (odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.13; P=.04) of having LTL in the lowest  tertile (vs highest); leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior was not  associated with values in the middle (vs highest) tertile (odds ratio, 1.01; 95\%  CI, 0.95-1.07; P=.62).

As an illustration of the different uses of mixture methods, we  employed methods geared toward distinct research questions concerning persistent  organic chemicals (POPs) as a mixture and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) as an  outcome. METHODS: With information on 18 POPs and LTL among 1,003 U.S. adults  (NHANES, 2001-2002), we used unsupervised methods including clustering to  identify profiles of similarly exposed participants, and Principal Component  Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify common exposure  patterns. We also employed supervised learning techniques, including penalized,  weighted quantile sum (WQS), and Bayesian kernel machine (BKMR) regressions, to  identify potentially toxic agents, and characterize nonlinear associations,  interactions, and the overall mixture effect. RESULTS: Clustering separated  participants into high, medium, and low POP exposure groups; longer log-LTL was  found among those with high exposure. The first PCA component represented overall  POP exposure and was positively associated with log-LTL. Two EFA factors, one  representing furans and the other PCBs 126 and 118, were positively associated  with log-LTL. Penalized regression methods selected three congeners in common  (PCB 126, PCB 118, and furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf) as potentially toxic agents. WQS  found a positive overall effect of the POP mixture and identified six POPs as  potentially toxic agents (furans 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hxcdf, 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, and  1,2,3,6,7,8-hxcdf, and PCBs 99, 126, 169). BKMR found a positive linear  association with furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, suggestive evidence of linear  associations with PCBs 126 and 169, and a positive overall effect of the mixture,  but no interactions among congeners. CONCLUSIONS: Using different methods, we  identified patterns of POP exposure, potentially toxic agents, the absence of  interaction, and estimated the overall mixture effect. These applications and  results may serve as a guide for mixture method selection based on specific  research questions.},

Measures of biological aging could provide  sensitive endpoints for studies of risk factors hypothesized to shorten healthy  lifespan and/or interventions that extend it. But uncertainty remains about how  to measure biological aging and if proposed measures assess the same thing.  METHOD: We tested four proposed measures of biological aging that could be  quantified with available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES), Klemera-Doubal method (KDM) Biological Age, homeostatic  dysregulation, Levine Method (LM) Biological Age, and leukocyte telomere length.  RESULTS: We analyzed data collected during 1999-2002, when all four biological  aging meausres could be taken. Participants' KDM biological ages, homeostatic  dysregulation levels, LM biological ages, and telomere length were all correlated  with their chronological ages. KDM Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation, and  LM Biological Age were all correlated with one another, but these measures were  uncorrelated with telomere length. Participants' with more advanced biological  aging performed worse on tests of physical, cognitive, and perceptual functioning  and reported more limitations to their daily activities and more pain, and rated  themselves as being in worse health. In parallel, participants with risk factors  for shorter healthy lifespan exhibited more advanced biological aging. In both  sets of analyses, effect-sizes tended to be larger for KDM Biological Age,  homeostatic dysregulation, and LM Biological Age as compared to telomere length.  DISCUSSION: The cellular-level aging biomarker telomere length may measure  different aspects of the aging process as compared to the patient-level  physiological composite measures KDM Biological Age, homeostatic dysregulation,  and LM Biological Age. Studies aiming to test if risk factors accelerate aging or  if interventions may slow aging should not treat proposed measures of aging as  interchangeable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying the impact of environmental mixtures on human health is an important topic. However, such studies face challenges when exposure  measurements lie below limit of detection (LOD). While various approaches for  accommodating a single exposure subject to LOD have been used, their impact on  mixture analysis has not been thoroughly investigated. Our study aims to  understand the impact of five popular LOD accommodation approaches on mixture  analysis results with multiple exposures subject to LOD, including omitting  subjects with any exposures below LOD (complete case analysis); single  imputations by LOD/ [Formula: see text] , and by estimates from a censored  accelerated failure time (AFT) model; and multiple imputation (MI) with or  without truncation based on LOD. METHODS: In extensive simulation studies with  high-dimensional and highly correlated exposures and a continuous health outcome,  we examined the performance of each LOD approach on three mixture analysis  methods: elastic net regression, weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) and  Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). We further analyzed data from the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on how persistent  organic pollutants (POPs) influenced leukocyte telomere length (LTL). RESULTS:  Complete case analysis was inefficient and could result in severe bias for some  mixture methods. Imputation by LOD/ [Formula: see text] showed unstable  performance across mixture methods. Conventional MI was associated with  consistent mild biases, which can be reduced by using a truncated distribution  for imputation. Estimating censored values by AFT models had a minimal impact on  the results. In the NHANES analysis, imputation by LOD/ [Formula: see text] ,  truncated MI and censored AFT models performed similarly, with a positive overall  effect of POPs on LTL while PCB126, PCB169 and furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf being the  most important exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Our study favored using truncated MI and  censored AFT models to accommodate values below LOD for the stability of  downstream mixture analysis.},

	abstract = {Dietary factors, including dietary fat, may affect the biological aging process, as reflected by the shortening of telomere length (TL), by affecting levels of  oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. We examined the direct relations of  total and types of dietary fats and fat-rich foods to peripheral leukocyte TL. In  4029 apparently healthy postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's  Health Initiative, intakes of total fat, individual fatty acids, and fat-rich  foods were assessed by a questionnaire. TL was measured by quantitative  polymerase chain reaction. Intake of short-to-medium-chain saturated fatty acids  (SMSFAs; aliphatic tails of ≤ 12 carbons) was inversely associated with TL.  Compared with participants in other quartiles of SMSFA intake, women who were in  the highest quartile (median: 1.29\% of energy) had shorter TLs [mean: 4.00 kb  (95\% CI: 3.89, 4.11 kb)], whereas women in the lowest quartile of intake (median:  0.29\% of energy) had longer TLs [mean: 4.13 kb (95\% CI: 4.03, 4.24 kb); P-trend =  0.046]. Except for lauric acid, all other individual SMSFAs were inversely  associated with TL (P {\textless} 0.05). In isoenergetic substitution models, the  substitution of 1\% of energy from SMSFAs with any other energy source was  associated with 119 bp longer TLs (95\% CI: 21, 216 bp). Intakes of nonskim milk,  butter, and whole-milk cheese (major sources of SMSFAs) were all inversely  associated with TL. No significant associations were found with long-chain  saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty  acids. In conclusion, we found that higher intakes of SMSFAs and SMSFA-rich foods  were associated with shorter peripheral leukocyte TL among postmenopausal women.  These findings suggest the potential roles of SMSFAs in the rate of biological  aging.},

This study aimed to explore the impact of aging  and sarcopenia on telomere length and TERRA expression, and changes following  strengthening exercise and nutrition intervention (supplement of branched-chain  amino acids, calcium and vitamin D3) for 12 weeks in the sarcopenic population.  Older adults (≥65 years old) were divided into non-sarcopenic controls (n = 36)  and sarcopenic individuals (n = 36) after measurement of grip strength and body  composition. The relative telomere length of leukocytes in all research  participants was evaluated using the T/S ratio (telomere/single copy gene), and  relative TERRA expression of leukocytes was determined by reverse-transcription  qPCR (RT-qPCR). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to analyze the  influence of sarcopenia and intervention on the outcomes. There was no  significant difference in telomere length between control subjects and  participants with sarcopenia. TERRA expression was lower in sarcopenic  participants compared to that in non-sarcopenic controls (5.18 ± 2.98 vs. 2.51 ±  1.89; p {\textless} 0.001). In the sarcopenic group, intervention significantly increased  TERRA expression, but not telomere length. The GEE analysis demonstrated that  TERRA expression was negatively associated with sarcopenia (β coefficient =  -2.705, p {\textless} 0.001) but positively associated with intervention (β coefficient =  1.599, p = 0.023). Sarcopenia is associated with a decrease in TERRA expression  in leukocytes. Rebound TERRA expression (returning to the level similar to the  non-sarcopenic controls) was observed in the sarcopenic group after exercise and  nutrition intervention. Future studies are warranted to examine the potential of  TERRA as a biomarker for sarcopenia and its subsequent responses to intervention.},

We  investigated the association between LTL and overall cardiovascular health (CVH)  as defined by the American Heart Association and whether the association is  modified by sex and race/ethnicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 5194 adults  (aged ≥20) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002.  CVH was defined as a composite score of the 7 metrics (smoking, physical  activity, diet, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting  blood glucose) and categorized as "poor," "intermediate," and "ideal." LTL was  assayed from whole blood using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method  relative to standard reference DNA. Multivariable linear regression models were  used to estimate the association between CVH and log-transformed LTL. We found  strong graded association between CVH and LTL in the overall sample, with  evidence of dose-response relationship (P for trend=0.013). Individuals with poor  and intermediate CVH had significantly shorter LTL than individuals with ideal  CVH (-3.4\% [95\% CI=-6.0\%, -0.8\%] and -2.4\% [-4.4\%, -0.3\%], respectively), after  adjustment for demographic variables, socioeconomic status, and C-reactive  protein. The association was stronger in women (-6.6\% [-10.2\%, -2.9\%] for poor vs  ideal CVH) and non-Hispanic whites (-4.3\% [-7.1\%, -1.4\%] for poor vs ideal CVH).  CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that less-than-ideal CVH is associated with  shorter LTL, but this association varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Future  longitudinal research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the  association between CVH and LTL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences (TTAGGG) and their associated proteins at the end of eukaryote chromosomes. Telomere length shortens  throughout the lifespan with each cell division, and leukocyte telomere length  (LTL) is often used as a biomarker of cellular aging. LTL is related to many  chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, to our  knowledge, the relation between LTL and risk factors for cardiovascular disease  and diabetes, such as dietary intake of processed meat and unprocessed red meat,  is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of processed meat  intake and unprocessed red meat intake with LTL. METHODS: This cross-sectional  study comprised 2846 American Indians from the Strong Heart Family Study who  participated in the 2001-2003 examination. Dietary factors, including past-year  consumption of processed meat and unprocessed red meat, were assessed with the  use of a 119-item Block Food-Frequency Questionnaire. LTL was measured with the  use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Generalized estimating equations  were used to examine the associations of intake of processed meat and unprocessed  red meat with LTL. RESULTS: Consumption of processed meat was negatively  associated with LTL after adjustment for age, sex, site, education, smoking,  alcohol use, physical activity, and other dietary factors. For every additional  daily serving of processed meat, LTL was 0.021 units (telomeric  product-to-single-copy gene ratio) shorter (β ± SE = -0.021 ± 0.008, P = 0.009).  No association was observed between the intake of unprocessed red meat and LTL (β  ± SE = 0.008 ± 0.011, P = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: In the Strong Heart Family Study,  consumption of processed meat, but not unprocessed red meat, was associated with  shorter LTL, a potential mediator for several age-related diseases. Further  studies are needed to better understand the biological mechanism by which  processed meat intake influences cellular aging.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Equol has been shown to improve skin health and regeneration, due to its antioxidative, phytoestrogenic and epigenetic characteristics. The effects of  a topical intervention on skin structure, telomere length and epigenetic markers  in skin cells were analysed. METHODS: Sixty-four participants were divided in  four groups and three of them treated topically with the following: emulsion with  Equol powder (Isoflavandiol-E-55-RS®); emulsion with microencapsulated Equol  (Vesisorb® Isoflavandiol-E-55-RS®) and an emulsion with lecithin (Vesisorb®  placebo). A control group of 6 volunteers did not receive any intervention. The  active compound was a 0.5\% equol-racemate. For 58 participants, all samples were  collected. Structural analysis, molecular analysis and questionnaires were  performed at the start of the study and after 8 weeks of intervention, twice a  day. Structural skin parameters were analysed by Visioscan® VC 98 and Cutometer®  dual MPA 580. Molecular analyses from epidermal cells collected by skin stripping  of the forehead included telomere length and LINE-1 methylation, following DNA  extraction, bisulfite conversion and qPCR as well as high-resolution melting  curve analysis. Effects of nutrition and lifestyle habits were evaluated with a  standardized food and lifestyle questionnaire. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The  surface analysis showed significant improvements in skin roughness, skin texture  and skin smoothness after both interventions. Cutometer® dual MPA 580 measurement  revealed improvement of skin firmness and elasticity parameters for both  preparations. A decrease in mean LINE-1 methylation (n.s.) and telomere length  (sign. P {\textless} 0.05) was observed in the sample group with age. In the treated  groups, significantly longer telomeres were observed after intervention. Whether  changes in telomere length reflect changes in the regulation of telomerase,  epigenetic interactions or turnover of keratinocytes needs further research.  Stability and availability of preparations in skin seems to be high as not many  significant differences in the activity of pure or encapsulated substances were  seen. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that equol has beneficial  effects on structural as well as molecular skin parameters and encourages further  investigations to decipher the epigenetic regulation of skin ageing and  interactions of equol.},

	abstract = {Variable importance is a key statistical issue in exposure mixtures, as it allows a ranking of exposures as potential targets for intervention, and helps to  identify bad actors within a mixture. In settings where mixtures have many  constituents or high between-constituent correlations, estimators of importance  can be subject to bias or high variance. Current approaches to assessing variable  importance have major limitations, including reliance on overly strong or  incorrect constraints or assumptions, excessive model extrapolation, or poor  interpretability, especially regarding practical significance. We sought to  overcome these limitations by applying an established doubly-robust, machine  learning-based approach to estimating variable importance in a mixtures context.  This method reduces model extrapolation, appropriately controls confounding, and  provides both interpretability and model flexibility. We illustrate its use with  an evaluation of the relationship between telomere length, a measure of biologic  aging, and exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins,  and furans among 979 US adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES). In contrast with standard approaches for mixtures, our approach  selected PCB 180 and PCB 194 as important contributors to telomere length. We  hypothesize that this difference could be due to residual confounding in standard  methods that rely on variable selection. Further empirical evaluation of this  method is needed, but it is a promising tool in the search for bad actors within  a mixture.},

PA-M1 included body composition, blood and  urine biomarkers, and disease variables as predictors. PA-M2 had blood and  urine-derived variables as predictors. Activity phenotypes for cytochrome-P450  (CYP) CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, xanthine oxidase (XO), and N-acetyltransferase-2  (NAT-2) and telomere attrition were assessed. Bayesian networks were used to  obtain mechanistic systems pharmacology model structures for PA. The study  included n = 22,307 NHANES participants (51.5\% female, mean age 46.0 years,  range: 18-79 years). The PA-M1 and PA-M2 distributions had greater dispersion  across age strata with a right skew for younger age strata and a left skew for  older age strata. There was no evidence of algorithmic bias based on sex or  race/ethnicity. Klotho, lean body mass, glycohemoglobin, and systolic blood  pressure were the top four predictors for PA-M1. Glycohemoglobin, serum  creatinine, total cholesterol, and urine creatinine were the top four predictors  for PA-M2. The models also performed satisfactorily in independent validation.  Model-predicted PA was associated with CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, XO, and NAT-2  activity. Telomere attrition was associated with greater PA-M1 and PA-M2.  Ensemble learning models provide robust assessments of PA from easily obtained  blood and urine biomarkers. PA is associated with Phase I drug-metabolizing  enzyme phenotypes.},

The aim of this study  was to examine associations between salivary telomere length (TL) and diet  quality using 5 evidence-based dietary indexes in an elderly ({\textgreater}55 years old)  Spanish population of the SUN project (n = 886). METHOD: TL was measured using  the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Age-adjusted TL variable  through residuals methods was used for all analysis. Diet quality was assessed by  the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS), Fat Quality Index (FQI), Mediterranean Diet  Adherence Screener (MEDAS), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index  and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010). RESULTS: TL did differ  according to sex, smoking status, and dyslipidemia in elderly subjects of the SUN  study. In addition, subjects with dyslipidemia (compared to absence of  dyslipidemia) had a significantly higher risk (27\% vs. 18\%, p = 0.015) of short  telomeres ({\textless}percentile 20th). Interestingly, a lower risk of having short  telomeres was observed among participants in the top tertiles of the following  diet quality score PDQS, MEDAS and DASH compared to the bottom tertiles in crude  and adjusted models. Moreover, FQI and AHEI-2010 scores showed an inverse  association with the risk of having short telomeres after adjustment for  potential confounders (model adjusted for dyslipidemia interaction, p for  trend = 0.025 and 0.021, respectively; and model additionally adjusted for sex  and smoking status, p for trend = 0.033 and 0.029, respectively).

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to examine the relationship between four  dimensions of HRQOL and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) among a nationally  representative sample of 3547 US adults (≥20 years) using the data from the  2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. METHOD: We used HRQOL  survey information collected on individuals' self-rated general health, recent  physical health, recent mental health, and recent activity limitation. Telomere  length was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Multiple linear  regressions were used to estimate the relationship between each dimension of  HRQOL and log-transformed values of LTL with adjustment for sample weights and  design effects. RESULTS: HRQOL-race interactions were significant, and the  results were stratified by race. After controlling for demographic factors,  disease conditions, and lifestyle variables, worse general health was  significantly associated with shorter LTL for Blacks (coefficient, β: -0.022, 95\%  Confidence Interval, 95\% CI: -0.03 to -0.01), but not for Whites or Mexican  Americans. Unwell physical health was associated with shorter telomere length for  Whites (β: -0.005, 95\% CI: -0.01 to -0.001) only. Unwell mental health showed no  significant association with LTL in any race. CONCLUSIONS: Although longitudinal  studies are needed to prove causality, our findings suggest that HRQOL could be  associated with LTL shortening. We also found a possible racial difference in  this association and recommend additional multiethnic studies to confirm this and  to understand the reasons and consequences of this difference.},

	abstract = {The aim of the study is to explore the longitudinal association of dietary acrylamide exposure with cognitive performance in Chinese elderly. The analysis  was conducted among 2534 non-smoking elderly men and women based on a prospective  study, Mr. and Ms. OS Hong Kong. Dietary acrylamide intake was assessed by food  frequency questionnaires with data on local food contamination, derived from the  first Hong Kong Total Diet Study. Global cognitive function was assessed by  Cantonese version of Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) at the baseline and the 4(th)  year of follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression models  were used to assess the associations of dietary acrylamide with MMSE score  changes or risk of poor cognition. The results indicated that among men with  MMSE ≥ 18, each one SD increase of acrylamide decreased MMSE score by 7.698\%  (95\%CI: -14.943\%, -0.452\%; p = 0.037). Logistic regression revealed an increased  risk of poor cognition (MMSE ≤ 26) in men with HR of 3.356 (1.064{\textasciitilde}10.591,  p = 0.039). The association became non-significance after further adjustment for  telomere length. No significant association was observed in women. Dietary  acrylamide exposure was associated with a mild cognitive decline or increased  risk of poor cognition over a 4-year period in non-smoking Chinese elderly men.},

	abstract = {By tracking a group of individuals through time, cohort studies provide fundamental insights into the developmental time course and causes of health and  disease. Evolutionary life history theory seeks to explain patterns of growth,  development, reproduction and senescence, and inspires a range of hypotheses that  are testable using the longitudinal data from cohort studies. Here we review two  decades of life history theory-motivated work conducted in collaboration with the  Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS), a birth cohort study that  enrolled more than 3000 pregnant women in the Philippines in 1983 and has since  followed these women, their offspring and grandoffspring. This work has provided  evidence that reproduction carries "costs" to cellular maintenance functions,  potentially speeding senescence, and revealed an unusual form of genetic  plasticity in which the length of telomeres inherited across generations is  influenced by reproductive timing in paternal ancestors. Men in Cebu experience  hormonal and behavioural changes in conjunction with changes in relationship and  fatherhood status that are consistent with predictions based upon other species  that practice bi-parental care. The theoretical expectation that early life cues  of mortality or environmental unpredictability will motivate a "fast" life  history strategy are confirmed for behavioural components of reproductive  decision making, but not for maturational tempo, while our work points to a  broader capacity for early life developmental calibration of systems like  immunity, reproductive biology and metabolism. Our CLHNS findings illustrate the  power of life history theory as an integrative, lifecourse framework to guide  longitudinal studies of human populations.},
