This study investigates the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and mortality risk from influenza and pneumonia. Utilizing data from a large cohort, we measured LTL and tracked mortality outcomes over a follow-up period. Our findings indicate that shorter LTL is significantly associated with an increased risk of death from influenza and pneumonia, independent of traditional risk factors. Notably, this association is more pronounced in men than in women. These results suggest that LTL may serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to severe respiratory infections and highlight the importance of considering biological aging in public health strategies."}

{"question": "How is telomere length (TL) related to bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC)", "answer": " TL positively correlated with BMD and BMC in most body parts, but showed a negative correlation in the upper limbs and skull.", "pmid": "37744360", "abstract": "Purpose: There has been an association between changes in body composition, fracture incidence, and age in previous studies. Telomere length (TL) has been proposed as a biomarker of aging. However, the relationship between body composition, fractures, and TL has rarely been studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the correlation between TL and body composition and fractures.Patients and methods: 20950 participants from the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in the final analysis. In NHANES, body compositions were measured with DXA, and TL was determined with quantitative PCR. Correlation analysis of TL and body composition was conducted using multivariate weighted linear regression and logistic regression models. Results: The results showed that TL positively correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in most body parts. However, BMD and BMC were negatively connected with TL in the upper limbs and skull. Fat content was negatively associated with TL, while muscle content was positively linked to TL. In addition, TL's trend analysis results were consistent with the regression model when transformed from a continuous to a classified variable. An increase in TL was associated with a higher incidence of wrist fractures, while a decrease in spine fractures. The above correlation also has a certain degree of sex specificity. Conclusion: Our study indicate that TL is associated with body composition as well as fractures, but further research is needed to confirm these contrasting associations in the skull, upper limbs, and wrists.

{"question": "How did telomere length (TL) mediate the relationship between pollutant exposure and metabolic syndrome (MetS)?", "answer": "Principal component analysis showed that TL explained 26.1% of the effect of PC2 and 17.1% of PC4 on MetS risk in males, and 17.7% of the effect of PC2 on MetS in females.", "pmid": "37322399", "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a chronic and complex disease characterized by environmental and genetic factors. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study assessed the relationship between exposure to a mixture of environmental chemicals and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and further examined whether telomere length (TL) moderated these relationships. A total of 1265 adults aged > 20 years participated in the study. Data on multiple pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, and metals), MetS, leukocyte telomere length (LTL), and confounders were provided in the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The correlations between multi-pollutant exposure, TL, and MetS in the males and females were separately assessed using principal component analysis (PCA), logistic and extended linear regression models, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and mediation analysis. Four factors were generated in PCA that accounted for 76.2% and 77.5% of the total environmental pollutants in males and females, respectively. The highest quantiles of PC2 and PC4 were associated with the risk of TL shortening (P < 0.05). We observed that the relationship between PC2, PC4, and MetS risk was significant in the participants with median TL levels (P for trend = 0.04 for PC2, and P for trend = 0.01 for PC4). Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that TL could explain 26.1% and 17.1% of the effects of PC2 and PC4 associated with MetS in males, respectively. The results of BKMR model revealed that these associations were mainly driven by 1-PYE (cPIP = 0.65) and Cd (cPIP = 0.29) in PC2. Meanwhile, TL could explain 17.7% of the mediation effects of PC2 associated with MetS in the females. However, the relationships between pollutants and MetS were sparse and inconsistent in the females. Our findings suggest that the effects of the risk of MetS associated with mixed exposure to multiple pollutants are mediated by TL, and this mediating effect in the males is more pronounced than that in the females."}

Linear regression is mainly used for correlation analysis of PAHs with selected covariate adjustments.

", "pmid": "36890680", "abstract": "Aims: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL), as a biomarker of biological aging, is associated with the prevalence and complications of diabetes. This study aims to investigate the associations between LTL and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: All participants with baseline LTL records were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. Death status and its causes were ascertained for National Death Index based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code. Cox proportional hazards regression models were established to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of LTL associating with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Results: The study enrolled 804 diabetic patients with the mean follow-up of 14.9 ± 2.59 years. There were 367 (45.6%) all-cause deaths, 80 (10.0%) cardiovascular deaths, and 42 (5.2%) cancer-related deaths. Longer LTL was associated with reduced all-cause mortality, whereas this association disappeared after adjusting for other variables. Compared with the lowest tertiles of LTL, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of cardiovascular mortality was 2.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-3.39; p < .05) in the highest tertiles. In terms of cancer mortality, the highest tertile was negatively correlated with the risk of cancer mortality (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.37, 0.91], p < .05). Conclusion: In conclusion, LTL was independently associated with the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and was negatively correlated with the risk of cancer mortality. Telomere length may be a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in diabetes. Keywords: NHANES; cross-sectional study; diabetes; leukocyte telomere length; mortality;"}

Studies have also shown that vitamin C acts as an oxidant and free radical scavenger to protect cells from oxidative stress and telomere wear, thus achieving anti-aging effects. At present, there are few and incomplete studies on the relationship between vitamin C and telomere length, so this study aims to explore the relationship between vitamin C and telomere length. Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) database from 1999 to 2002, a total of 7,094 participants were selected from all races in the United States. Male participants accounted for 48.2% and female participants accounted for 51.8%. The correlation between vitamin C and telomere length was assessed using a multiple linear regression model, and the effect of dietary vitamin C on telomere length was obtained after adjusting for confounding factors such as age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and poverty income ratio (PIR). Results: This cross-sectional study showed that vitamin C was positively correlated with telomere length, with greater dietary vitamin C intake associated with longer telomeres (β = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.05, P = 0.003). Conclusion: This study shows that vitamin C intake is positively correlated with human telomere length, which is of guiding significance for our clinical guidance on people's health care, but our study need to be confirmed by more in-depth and comprehensive other research results.
