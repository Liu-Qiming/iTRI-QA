BACKGROUND: The relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and 
mortality risk in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains poorly 
understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between telomere 
length and long-term all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
mortality, in individuals with MetS in the United States.
METHODS: A total of 1980 participants with MetS aged 18 years or older from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) prospective cohort 
study (1999-2002) were included in this cohort study. Medical records review was 
used to identify the cause of deaths as of December 2018. We employed 
Kaplan-Meier curves, fitted curves, and Cox proportional hazards regression 
models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and CVD mortality, 
stratified by tertiles of LTL.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 17.75 years of participants with metabolic 
syndrome, 819 deaths occurred, including 231 cardiovascular deaths. After 
adjusting for multiple covariates, participants with shorter telomere length had 
a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.11-1.6) 
and CVD mortality (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.96-1.93) compared with those in the 
highest tertile of telomere length. All-cause mortality (P < 0.001) and 
cardiovascular disease mortality (P = 0.028) followed a similar pattern across 
tertiles of telomere length.
CONCLUSION: In individuals with MetS, shorter telomere length is associated with 
increased risks of death from cardiovascular disease and all causes. The 
underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these findings require 
additional investigation.

BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to cadmium-polluted environments may lead to 
shortened leukocyte telomere length and cognitive decline. This study aims to 
investigate (1) the associations among blood cadmium levels, leukocyte telomere 
length, and cognitive function, and (2) the mediating role of leukocyte telomere 
length between blood cadmium levels and cognitive function among older adults in 
the United States.
METHODS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) 1999-2002. Cadmium exposure level was assessed by measuring cadmium 
levels in blood samples. Leukocyte telomere length was measured by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction, and cognitive function was measured by the digit 
symbol substitution test (DSST).
RESULTS: A total of 2185 older adults aged over 60 were included in this study, 
comprising 1109 (49.65%) males. Elevated blood cadmium levels were significantly 
associated with the risk of a decline in cognitive function (β = - 2.842, 
p = 0.018). Shorter leukocyte telomere lengths were significantly associated 
with a higher risk of a decline in cognitive function (β = 4.144, p = 0.020). 
The total indirect effect on the blood cadmium level and cognitive function via 
leukocyte telomere length was - 0.218 (p = 0.012). The mediation effect was 
estimated to be 0.218/2.084 × 100% = 10.46%.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that cadmium exposure may increase the risk of 
cognitive impairment by causing shortened leukocyte telomere length.

BACKGROUND: Due to the ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 
interest has arisen to realize the relationship between telomere length (TL) and 
influenza and pneumonia mortality.
AIM: Our study attempted to investigate this correlation by analyzing 
information gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) 1999-2002.
METHODS: A total of 7229 participants were involved in the conducted research. 
We utilized Cox proportional risk model analysis to determine the hazard ratio 
(HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for TL and influenza and pneumonia 
mortality.
RESULTS: During the average follow-up time of 204.10 ± 51.26 months, 33 (0.45%) 
participants died from influenza and pneumonia. After adjusting for multiple 
variables, shorter TL was associated with higher influenza-pneumonia mortality. 
In subgroup analyses stratified by sex, men exhibited stronger associations with 
influenza-pneumonia mortality than women (Model 1: HRmale: 0.014 vs HRfemale: 
0.054; Model 2: HRmale: 0.082 vs HRfemale: 0.890; Model 3: HRmale: 0.072 vs 
HRfemale: 0.776). For subgroup analyses by visceral adiposity index (VAI), all 
statistically significant (P < 0.05) models displayed an inverse relationship 
between TL and influenza and pneumonia mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides further proof for the connection between 
shorter telomeres and higher influenza-pneumonia mortality. Larger prospective 
researches are essential to support our results and explain the underlying 
mechanisms.

The exposome, reflecting the range of environmental exposures individuals 
encounter throughout their life, can influence a variety of health outcomes and 
can play a role in how the environment impacts our genes. Telomeres, genetic 
structures regulating cell growth and senescence, are one pathway through which 
the exposome may impact health. Greenspace exposure, representing the amount of 
green areas in one's neighborhood, is one component of the exposome and has been 
associated with multiple health benefits. To investigate the potential link 
between greenspace exposure and telomere length, we analyzed data from the 
1999-2001 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sample. Our 
study examined individual, risk, and contextual factors. We found that greater 
greenspace exposure in one's neighborhood was associated with longer telomere 
lengths when considering individual and risk factors, suggesting a positive 
effect of living in greener neighborhoods. However, this relationship became 
non-significant when contextual factors, such as air pollution and deprivation, 
were included in the analysis. These findings highlight a complex relationship 
between greenspace and telomere length, warranting further research to explore 
contextual factors in detail.

PURPOSE: There has been an association between changes in body composition, 
fracture incidence, and age in previous studies. Telomere length (TL) has been 
proposed as a biomarker of aging. However, the relationship between body 
composition, fractures, and TL has rarely been studied. Therefore, this study 
aimed to investigate the correlation between TL and body composition and 
fractures.Patients and methods: 20950 participants from the 2001-2002 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in the final 
analysis. In NHANES, body compositions were measured with DXA, and TL was 
determined with quantitative PCR. Correlation analysis of TL and body 
composition was conducted using multivariate weighted linear regression and 
logistic regression models.
RESULTS: The results showed that TL positively correlated with bone mineral 
density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in most body parts. However, BMD 
and BMC were negatively connected with TL in the upper limbs and skull. Fat 
content was negatively associated with TL, while muscle content was positively 
linked to TL. In addition, TL's trend analysis results were consistent with the 
regression model when transformed from a continuous to a classified variable. An 
increase in TL was associated with a higher incidence of wrist fractures, while 
a decrease in spine fractures. The above correlation also has a certain degree 
of sex specificity.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicate that TL is associated with body composition as 
well as fractures, but further research is needed to confirm these contrasting 
associations in the skull, upper limbs, and wrists.

Metabolic syndrome is a chronic and complex disease characterized by 
environmental and genetic factors. However, the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. This study assessed the relationship between exposure to a mixture of 
environmental chemicals and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and further examined 
whether telomere length (TL) moderated these relationships. A total of 1265 
adults aged > 20 years participated in the study. Data on multiple pollutants 
(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, and metals), MetS, leukocyte 
telomere length (LTL), and confounders were provided in the 2001-2002 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The correlations between 
multi-pollutant exposure, TL, and MetS in the males and females were separately 
assessed using principal component analysis (PCA), logistic and extended linear 
regression models, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and mediation 
analysis. Four factors were generated in PCA that accounted for 76.2% and 77.5% 
of the total environmental pollutants in males and females, respectively. The 
highest quantiles of PC2 and PC4 were associated with the risk of TL shortening 
(P < 0.05). We observed that the relationship between PC2, PC4, and MetS risk 
was significant in the participants with median TL levels (P for trend = 0.04 
for PC2, and P for trend = 0.01 for PC4). Furthermore, mediation analysis 
revealed that TL could explain 26.1% and 17.1% of the effects of PC2 and PC4 
associated with MetS in males, respectively. The results of BKMR model revealed 
that these associations were mainly driven by 1-PYE (cPIP = 0.65) and Cd 
(cPIP = 0.29) in PC2. Meanwhile, TL could explain 17.7% of the mediation effects 
of PC2 associated with MetS in the females. However, the relationships between 
pollutants and MetS were sparse and inconsistent in the females. Our findings 
suggest that the effects of the risk of MetS associated with mixed exposure to 
multiple pollutants are mediated by TL, and this mediating effect in the males 
is more pronounced than that in the females.

Although an association between single polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
adult exposure and telomere length has been reported, the evidence of mixed PAHs 
(1-napthol, 2-napthol, 3-fluorene, 2-fluorene, 3-phenanthrene, 1-phenanthrene, 
2-phenanthrene, and 1-pyrene) exposure and telomere length in the adult general 
population is still not clear. A total of 1460 adults over the age of 20 years 
provided urine information on 8 PAHs and selected covariates from the 2001-2002 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Bayesian nuclear 
machine regression (BKMR) was conducted to analyze these associations of 
telomere length in multiple PAH-exposed environments. Linear regression is 
mainly used for correlation analysis of PAHs with selected covariate 
adjustments. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) is used to estimate the correlation 
between selected PAHs and telomere length. After adjusting for potential 
covariates, PAHs mixed exposure was negatively associated with telomere length. 
The linear regression results showed that 2-napthol and 2-fluorene were 
negatively correlated with telomere length. Telomere length decreased by 1.0% in 
the fully adjusted model per increment of one unit in the 
base-10-logarithm-transformed 2-napthol and 2-fluorene concentrations (P = 0.030 
and 0.049, respectively). However, the other 6 PAH metabolites were not 
significantly different. In addition, RCS results showed that 2-napthol has a 
marginal dose effect relationship with telomere length. Our present study 
suggested that PAHs are negatively associated with telomere length in the 
general population of the USA. Considering that the low level of PAHs exposure 
in the general population can also induce reduced telomere length and potential 
health risks, future research is needed to explore potential mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE: Previous research has shown a significant association between weight 
and telomere length, but did not take into consideration weight range. The study 
was to investigate the association of weight range with telomere length.
METHODS: Data of 2918 eligible participants aged 25-84 years from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000 cycle were analyzed. 
Information about demographic variables, lifestyle factors, anthropometric 
variables, and medical comorbidities were included. Univariate and multivariate 
linear regression model with adjustments for potential confounders were employed 
to determine the association between weight range and telomere length. A 
non-parametrically restricted cubic spline model was used to illustrate the 
possible non-linear relationship.
RESULTS: In univariate linear regression, BMImax, BMI range, and weight range 
all revealed significant negative associations with telomere length. However, 
annual rate of BMI/weight range showed a significant positive associations with 
telomere length. There was no significant association between telomere length 
and BMImin. After adjusting for potential confounders, the inverse associations 
persisted in BMImax (β=-0.003, P<0.001), BMI range (β=-0.002, P=0.003), and 
weight range (β=-0.001, P=0.001). Furthermore, annual rate of BMI range 
(β=-0.026, P=0.009) and weight range (β=-0.010, P=0.007) presented negative 
associations with telomere length, after adjusting for covariates in Model 2-4. 
The association between BMImin (β =-0.002, P=0.237) and telomere length still 
could not reach statistical significance in multivariate linear regression 
model. The results of restricted cubic spline analysis showed that BMImax (P for 
nonlinear =0.026), BMI range (P for nonlinear =0.022), weight range (P for 
nonlinear =0.035), annual rate of BMI range (P for nonlinear =0.030), and annual 
rate of weight range (P for nonlinear =0.027) all had nonlinear inverse 
associations with telomere length.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that weight range is inversely associated with 
telomere length in U.S. adults. Larger weight fluctuation may accelerate 
telomere shortening and aging.

AIMS: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL), as a biomarker of biological aging, is 
associated with the prevalence and complications of diabetes. This study aims to 
investigate the associations between LTL and all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: All participants with baseline LTL records were included from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. Death status and its 
causes were ascertained for National Death Index based on International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code. Cox proportional hazards 
regression models were established to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of LTL 
associating with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 804 diabetic patients with the mean follow-up of 
14.9 ± 2.59 years. There were 367 (45.6%) all-cause deaths, 80 (10.0%) 
cardiovascular deaths, and 42 (5.2%) cancer-related deaths. Longer LTL was 
associated with reduced all-cause mortality, whereas this association 
disappeared after adjusting for other variables. Compared with the lowest 
tertiles of LTL, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of cardiovascular 
mortality was 2.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-3.39; p < .05) in the 
highest tertiles. In terms of cancer mortality, the highest tertile was 
negatively correlated with the risk of cancer mortality (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.37, 
0.91], p < .05).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, LTL was independently associated with the risk of 
cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and was negatively 
correlated with the risk of cancer mortality. Telomere length may be a predictor 
of cardiovascular mortality in diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Currently, telomere length is known to reflect the replication 
potential and longevity of cells, and many studies have reported that telomere 
length is associated with age-related diseases and biological aging. Studies 
have also shown that vitamin C acts as an oxidant and free radical scavenger to 
protect cells from oxidative stress and telomere wear, thus achieving anti-aging 
effects. At present, there are few and incomplete studies on the relationship 
between vitamin C and telomere length, so this study aims to explore the 
relationship between vitamin C and telomere length.
METHODS: This study used cross-sectional data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) database from 1999 to 2002, a total of 
7,094 participants were selected from all races in the United States. Male 
participants accounted for 48.2% and female participants accounted for 51.8%. 
The correlation between vitamin C and telomere length was assessed using a 
multiple linear regression model, and the effect of dietary vitamin C on 
telomere length was obtained after adjusting for confounding factors such as 
age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), and poverty income ratio (PIR).
RESULTS: This cross-sectional study showed that vitamin C was positively 
correlated with telomere length, with greater dietary vitamin C intake 
associated with longer telomeres (β = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.05, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that vitamin C intake is positively correlated with 
human telomere length, which is of guiding significance for our clinical 
guidance on people's health care, but our study need to be confirmed by more 
in-depth and comprehensive other research results.

BACKGROUND: Telomere length, which is related to chronic diseases and premature 
mortality, is influenced by dietary factors. Zinc is known as a dietary 
antioxidant micronutrient, however, its impact on telomere length remains 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential effect of dietary zinc intake on 
telomere length among middle-aged and older individuals in the US.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 3,793 US participants aged 45 years 
and older from the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES). 24-h dietary recall interviews were employed to evaluate zinc 
consumption. Leukocyte telomere length was assessed by real-time quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We adopted generalized linear models to 
investigate the effect of dietary zinc intake on telomere length, and subgroup 
analyses were further applied. We further evaluated the dose-response 
relationship using restricted cubic spline analysis.
RESULTS: Among the 3,793 participants, the average telomere length was 0.926 ± 
0.205 (T/S ratio) or 5509.5 ± 494.9 (bp). After adjusting for major confounders, 
every 5 mg increment in dietary zinc consumption was related to 0.64% (95% CI: 
0.17%, 1.10%) longer telomere length. In the subgroup analyses, significant 
relationships were found in females (Percentage change: 1.11%; 95% CI: 0.48%, 
1.75%), obese (Percentage change: 0.88%; 95% CI: 0.26%, 1.50%), and low energy 
intake individuals (Percentage change: 0.99%; 95% CI: 0.51%, 1.46%). 
Additionally, we revealed a positive linear relationship between dietary zinc 
intake and telomere length (P for non-linearity = 0.636).
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that elevated dietary zinc intake was 
significantly related to longer telomere length among adults aged 45 years and 
older in the US. And the association was more pronounced in females, obese, and 
low energy intake individuals.

OBJECTIVE: The joint effect of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and type 2 
diabetes (T2D) on the risk of all-cause death has been sparsely explored. The 
study designed to examine the joint effect of T2D and LTL on the probability of 
death in American adults.
METHODS: A cohort of 6862 adults with LTL measurements and with or without T2D 
from the NHANES 1999-2002 with follow-up information until 2015 was studied. 
Quantitative PCR was used to measure the length of telomeres relative to 
standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Individuals were grouped into three tertiles 
according to the LTL levels, with the first tertile demonstrating the lowest one 
and used as the reference group. The effects of LTL and T2D status on death were 
evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves along with log-rank test. Three Cox 
proportional hazards models with adjustment for various confounders were used to 
examine the links between TL and all-cause death possibility using adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs).
RESULTS: Adults in the sample averaged 45.54 years of age, with 49.51% being 
male. After a median follow-up period of 14.4 years, 1543 (22.5%) individuals 
died from all cause. The probability of all-cause mortality was higher among 
individuals with LTL in the highest tertile than individuals in the lowest 
tertile (aHR = 0.89; 95%CI: 0.77-1.03); however, the difference did not reach 
the level of statistical significance (P = 0.11). Conversely, the individuals 
with T2D had a higher probability of death than individuals without (aHR = 1.26; 
95%CI: 1.06-1.50; P = 0.0092). When LTL and T2D status were investigated 
jointly, subjects in the highest TLT tertile and with T2D had the highest 
probability of mortality compared with their counterparts (aHR = 1.34; 95%CI: 
1.07-1.68; P = 0.0101). However, there was no independent effect of low TLT on 
mortality as demonstrated among individuals with diabetes (aHR = 1.14; 95%CI: 
0.95-1.38; P = 0.1662).
CONCLUSION: The joint effect of TLT and T2D was larger than the sum of the 
independent effects on the risk of all-cause death. Participants with high TLT 
and diabetes showed the highest possibility of death compared with other groups.

BACKGROUND: Dietary micronutrients are significantly associated with telomere 
length, as shown in multiple studies. However, no study has investigated the 
association between magnesium intake and telomere length in adults with 
hypertension.
METHODS: Participants were included from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. Dietary magnesium intake 
was assessed using the 24 - hour recall method and the telomere length of 
leukocytes was measured using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A multivariate 
regression model was then used to assess the association between dietary 
magnesium intake and telomere length in adults with hypertension.
RESULTS: Our final analysis included 2199 hypertensive adults (46.79% males) 
with a mean dietary magnesium intake of 254.82±133.47 mg/day. Linear regression, 
adjusted for race, sex, age, smoking, uric acid, and other variables, showed 
that every 1 mg increase in dietary magnesium intake was associated with a 0.20 
(95% CI: 0.01, 0.39, p = 0.043) longer telomere length in all participants. In 
the ≥45 years age group, there was a statistically significant association 
between the telomere length and dietary magnesium (95% CI: 0.16, 0.63, p 
<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that increased magnesium intake is associated 
with a longer telomere length in hypertensive adults, especially in those ≥45 
years of age. However, further research is needed to determine a causal 
relationship.

Despite racial disparities in diseases of aging and premature mortality, 
non-Hispanic Black Americans tend to have longer leukocyte telomere length 
(LTL), a biomarker of cellular aging, than non-Hispanic White Americans. 
Previous findings suggest that exposure to certain persistent organic pollutants 
(POPs) is both racially-patterned and associated with longer LTL. We examine 
whether Black/White differences in LTL are explained by differences in exposure 
to 15 POPs by estimating the indirect effect (IE) of self-reported race on LTL 
that is mediated through nine polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), three furans, 
and three dioxins, as well as their mixtures. Our study population includes 
1,251 adults from the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 cycles of the cross-sectional 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We characterized 
single-pollutant mediation effects by constructing survey-weighted linear 
regression models. We also implemented various approaches to quantify a global 
mediation effect of all POPs, including unpenalized linear regression, ridge 
regression, and examination of three summary exposure scores. We found support 
for the hypothesis that exposure to PCBs partially mediates Black/White 
differences in LTL. In single-pollutant models, there were significant IEs of 
race on LTL through six individual PCBs (118, 138, 153, 170, 180, and 187). 
Ridge regression (0.013, CI 0.001, 0.023; 26.0% mediated) and models examining 
summative exposure scores with linear combinations derived from principal 
components analysis (0.019, CI 0.009, 0.029; 34.8% mediated) and Toxic 
Equivalency Quotient (TEQ) scores (0.016, CI 0.005, 0.026; 28.8% mediated) 
showed significant IEs when incorporating survey weights. Exposures to 
individual POPs and their mixtures, which may arise from residential and 
occupational segregation, may help explain why Black Americans have longer LTL 
than their White counterparts, providing an environmental explanation for 
counterintuitive race differences in cellular aging.

OBJECTIVE: Leukocytes telomere length (LTL) was reported to be associated with 
cellular aging and aging related disease. Urine metal also might accelerate the 
development of aging related disease. We aimed to analyze the association 
between LTL and urinary metals.
METHODS: In this research, we screened all cycles of National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, and download the eligible dataset 
in NHANES 1999-2002 containing demographic, disease history, eight urine metal, 
and LTL. The analysis in this research had three steps including baseline 
difference comparison, multiple linear regression (MLR) for hazardous urine 
metals, and artificial neural network (ANN, based on Tensorflow framework) to 
make LTL prediction.
RESULTS: The MLR results showed that urinary cadmium (Cd) was negatively 
correlated with LTL in the USA population [third quantile: -9.36, 95% 
confidential interval (CI) = (-19.7, -2.32)], and in the elderly urinary 
molybdenum (Mo) was positively associated with LTL [third quantile: 24.37, 95%CI 
= (5.42, 63.55)]. An ANN model was constructed, which had 24 neurons, 0.375 exit 
rate in the first layer, 15 neurons with 0.53 exit rate in the second layer, and 
7 neurons with 0.86 exit rate in the third layer. The squared error loss (LOSS) 
and mean absolute error (MAE) in the ANN model were 0.054 and 0.181, 
respectively, which showed a low error rate.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in adults especially the elderly, the relationships 
between urinary Cd and Mo might be worthy of further research. An accurate 
prediction model based on ANN could be further analyzed.

Telomere length is affected by lifestyle and environmental factors and varies 
between racial and ethnic groups; however, studies are limited, with mixed 
findings. This study examined the effects of tobacco use and smoke exposure on 
mean telomere length to identify critical age periods by race/ethnicity. We used 
time-varying effect modeling on the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey for continuous years 1999-2002 to observe the effects of active tobacco 
use and environmental tobacco smoke-measured through serum cotinine-and mean 
telomere length for adults 19 to 85 and older (N = 7826). Models were run for 
Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and 
other/multi-race categories to allow for time-varying group differences, and 
controlled for biological sex, socioeconomic status, education, and ever-smoker 
status. Serum cotinine was found to have an increasing effect on telomere length 
from age 37 to approximately age 74 among Mexican Americans. Among 
other/multi-race individuals serum cotinine was found to have a decreasing 
effect at approximately age 42, and among Blacks, it had an overall decreasing 
effect from age 61 to 78. Findings reveal a further need to focus additional 
support and resources to intervene regarding disparate health effects from 
tobacco use and environmental smoke exposure for already vulnerable groups at 
particular ages.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the major 
health issues worldwide. Pathophysiological changes in COPD are mainly reflected 
in the deterioration of lung function with aging.
METHODS: Considering that telomere length is a hallmark of biological aging, we 
first performed a meta-analysis to summarize the current knowledge about the 
relationship between telomere length and COPD and then employed individual-level 
data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) to investigate whether telomere length could reflect accelerated aging 
in COPD and serve as an independent predictor. A mediation study was further 
performed to examine whether the association between telomeres and COPD could be 
mediated by inflammation, as one of the most important etiologies and 
characteristics of COPD.
RESULTS: The four studies included in our meta-analysis were with high 
heterogeneity (I2 = 95.7%, Phet < 0.001), and the pooled relative risk for COPD 
comparing the shortest tertile versus the longest tertile was 4.06 (95% 
CI = 1.38 to 11.96). Of the 6,378 subjects in the individual-level data analyses 
using NHANES, 455 were diagnosed with COPD, and multivariable-adjusted logistic 
regression also indicated that short telomere length was associated with COPD. 
Consistently, cubic regression spline analyses showed that long telomeres 
exhibited a significant association with a decreased risk of COPD. In the 
subsequent mediation analyses, C-reactive protein concentration, white blood 
cells count and blood neutrophil count, as inflammatory biomarkers, showed a 
significant indirect effect on the relationship between telomere length and 
COPD.
CONCLUSION: Accelerated aging in COPD could be characterized by excessive 
telomere shortening, and inflammatory response might be involved in the 
underlying mechanisms of COPD pathogenesis promoted by short telomere length. 
Telomere length measurement may facilitate clinical translational research and 
targeted therapy of COPD.

BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a robust marker of biological 
aging, which is associated with obesity. Recently, the visceral adiposity index 
(VAI) has been proposed as an indicator of adipose distribution and function.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluated the association between VAI and LTL in adult Americans.
METHODS: There were 3193 participants in U.S. National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surveys (1999-2002) included in this analysis. LTL was measured 
using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and expressed as telomere to single-gene copy 
ratio (T/S ratio). We performed multiple logistic regression models to explore 
the association between VAI and LTL by adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Among all participants, VAI was associated with the shorter LTL (β: 
 - 14.81, 95% CI  - 22.28 to  - 7.34, p < 0.001). There were significant 
differences of LTL in VAI tertiles (p < 0.001). Participants in the higher VAI 
tertile had the shorter LTL (1.26 ≤ VAI < 2.46: β =  - 130.16, 95% CI 
[ - 183.44,  - 76.87]; VAI ≥ 2.46: β =  - 216.12, 95% CI [ - 216.12,  - 81.42], 
p for trend: < 0.001) comparing with the lower VAI tertile. We also found a 
non-linear relationship between VAI and LTL. VAI was negatively correlated with 
LTL when VAI was less than 2.84.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that VAI is independently associated 
with telomere length. A higher VAI is associated with shorter LTL. The results 
suggest that VAI may provide prediction for LTL and account for accelerating the 
biological aging.

AIM: The present investigation was designed to test the association between 
leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and two simple markers of insulin resistance, 
that is, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and 
triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index in U.S. adults without metabolic diseases.
METHODS: A total of 6489 U.S. adults without diabetes from NHANES 1999-2002 were 
analyzed. TyG index was calculated as ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × 
fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2]. HOMA-Index was calculated as fasting plasma glucose 
(mmol/L) × fasting serum insulin (mU/mL)/22.5. LTL was obtained using the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Multivariate linear regression 
analysis was assessed to evaluate the association of TyG index HOMA-IR with LTL. 
We further conducted a generalized additive model (GAM) and a fitted smoothing 
curve with penalized spline method.
RESULTS: It was found that the mean LTL was 5796.1 bp in the measured healthy 
adults. Overall, TyG index was significantly associated with LTL, while HOMA-IR 
was not. Compared with participants in tertile 1 of the TyG index, the β (95% 
CI) for those in the second (8.27 to 8.77) and third (≥ 8.77) were -4.31 (95% 
CI: -48.12~39.49) and -95.98 (95% CI: -145.08~-46.89), respectively. Subjects 
with TyG index ≥ 8.77 had statistically significant shorter LTL (β = -93.33, 
95%CI: -134.33~-52.32), compared with TyG index < 8.77. We further explored a 
dose-response relation between TyG index by a decile approach [≤ 7.81 
(reference), 7.81-8.04, 8.04-8.21, 8.21-8.37, 8.37-8.52, 8.52-8.68, 8.68-8.83, 
8.83-9.03, 9.03-9.33, and >9.33] and LTL. Five subgroups (TyG index 7.81-8.04, 
8.04-8.21, 8.21-8.37, 8.37-8.52, and 8.52-8.68) did not show significant effect 
on LTL; while there was a significantly shorter LTL for participants with the 
TyG index > 8.68, supporting a threshold effect of TyG index on LTL.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that higher TyG index (> 8.68) was closely 
related to shorter LTL and the TyG index was better associated with LTL than 
HOMA-IR.

BACKGROUND: Although telomere length has a significant relationship with various 
age-related diseases, studies on its relationship with hearing status in adults 
are limited and equivocal. This study investigated the associations between mean 
telomere length (MTL) and low-, speech-, and high-frequency hearing threshold 
shifts of adults in the United States.
METHODS: A total of 2,027 adults, aged 20-69 years, from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES, 1999-2002) were included in the analytic 
sample. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used for the MTL 
assay, and MTL was expressed using the telomere-to-single copy gene (T/S) ratio. 
Hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone average (PTA) for the better ear at ≥ 20 
dB HL at frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz. Univariate and 
multivariate linear regression analyses and smooth curve fittings were conducted 
to evaluate the correlation between MTL and low-, speech-, and high-frequency 
hearing levels.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 40.60 ± 12.76 years, including 952 
men (weighted, 48.67%) and 303 (weighted, 12.88%) participants with hearing 
loss. After adjusting for potential confounders in the multivariate linear 
regression model, the relationship between MTL and hearing thresholds was not 
statistically significant. Smooth curve fittings indicated a non-linear 
relationship between MTL and high-frequency PTA hearing threshold shifts. MTL 
was inversely related to high-frequency PTA to the turning point (T/S ratio = 
0.82) (adjusted β-21.45, 95% CI -37.28, -5.62; P = 0.008). When the T/S ratio 
exceeded0.82, MTL was not associated with high-frequency PTA (adjusted β0.18, 
95% CI -2.21, 2.57; P = 0.8809).
CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that MTL was associated with high-frequency 
PTA hearing threshold shifts of adults in the United States in a non-linear 
manner.

Se is an indispensable trace element for the human body, and telomere length is 
considered a marker of biological ageing. Previous studies have shown that 
dietary Se intake is associated with telomere length. However, the relationship 
between Se intake and telomere length in patients with diabetes has not been 
well studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship 
between dietary Se intake and telomere length in patients with diabetes. We 
extracted 878 participants with diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey database for 1990-2002. Dietary Se intake was assessed using 
the 24 h dietary recall method, and telomere length was measured using 
quantitative PCR. Generalised linear models were constructed to assess the 
relationship between dietary Se intake and telomere length. After controlling 
for the confounders, 1 μg increase in dietary Se intake in female patients with 
diabetes, and telomere length increased by 1·84 base pairs (β = 1·84 (95 % CI: 
0·15, 3·53)), there was a line relationship between dietary Se intake and 
telomere length in female patients with diabetes and telomere length increased 
with increasing dietary Se intake within the range of 0-250 μg. The study 
demonstrates that dietary Se intake is significantly associated with telomere 
length only in the female population with diabetes in the USA. However, further 
prospective studies are required to confirm this finding.

BACKGROUND: More indications proved that diet might be involved in the telomere 
length, a marker of biological aging and chronic diseases. Copper is widely 
viewed as one of the essential elements in the diet. Therefore, this study aimed 
to evaluate the relationship between telomere length and dietary copper intake 
in hypertension and provide a basis for guiding dietary copper intake in 
patients with hypertension.
METHODS: The data was collected from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2000 and 2001-2002. The relevance between 
telomere length and dietary copper intake in hypertension is assessed using a 
multivariable linear regression model.
RESULTS: We gathered 1,867 participants with hypertension with assessed telomere 
length and dietary copper intake. We found that one unit increasing 
log-transformed dietary copper intake in hypertension was significantly 
associated with longer telomere length base pair (bp) (β = 112.20, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 5.48, 218.92), after controlling for covariates, 
including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and 
taking medication for hypertension. For the age group, we found that one unit 
increasing log-transformed dietary copper in hypertension was associated with 
longer telomere length (β = 237.95, 95% CI: 114.39, 361.51) in the age group >45 
years. The grouping was based on whether the participants take medication for 
hypertension. We found that one unit increasing log-transformed dietary copper 
in hypertension was associated with longer telomere length (β = 116.47, 95% CI: 
0.72, 232.21) in the group that takes medication for hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that dietary copper intake was associated 
with longer telomere length in patients with hypertension, which provides 
evidence for guiding dietary copper intake in patients with hypertension. 
However, further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of copper 
supplementation on telomere length in patients with hypertension in 
well-designed random control studies and prospective studies.

BACKGROUND: Dietary habits and dietary intake affect telomere length, a reliable 
marker of biological aging and a predictor of chronic disease. Riboflavin (RF) 
is known as a water-soluble antioxidant vitamin, but its role in telomere length 
maintenance has yet to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between 
dietary RF intake and telomere length in a nationally representative sample of 
adults.
METHODS: Using the NHANES (1999-2002), telomere data of 4,298 participants aged 
≥45 years were analyzed in a cross-sectional manner. Leukocyte telomere length 
was measured using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). 
Dietary RF intake was assessed by a trained interviewer using 24-h dietary 
recall method. Generalized linear regressions were performed to evaluate the 
association between dietary RF intake and telomere length. Subgroup analyses 
were performed to further explore this relationship in sex and body mass index 
(BMI) subgroups.
RESULTS: Among the 3,788 participants included, the average telomere length was 
longer in females (P = 0.014), while they had a lower average RF intake compared 
to males (P < 0.001). There was a weak positive correlation between RF intake 
and telomere length both when unadjusted (β = 0.011; P = 0.037) and adjusted for 
age, sex, and ethnicity (β = 0.013; P = 0.033). Subgroup analyses showed a 
positive association between RF intake and the telomere length in female after 
adjusting for confounding factors (β = 0.029; P = 0.046). In the female 
subgroup, there were significant positive relationships between telomere length 
and RF intake in the obese group (β = 0.086, P = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: Increased dietary RF intake was significantly associated with longer 
telomere length in middle-aged and older American females, especially in low RF 
intake obese female.

OBJECTIVES: Hysterectomy is one of the most common gynecological surgical 
procedures, and most hysterectomies are performed for benign indications. 
Despite the frequency and known benefits of the procedure, it remains unclear 
whether it has potential adverse effects on long-term health and longevity. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the association of age at benign hysterectomy 
with leukocyte telomere length, in data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2002.
STUDY DESIGN: In total, 811 women who had a hysterectomy were included in this 
cross-sectional study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To estimate the association of age at benign hysterectomy 
with telomere length, multivariate regression analyses adjusted for age, race/ 
ethnicity, education, marital status, income poverty ratio, body mass index 
(BMI), physical activity, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, history of 
chronic disease and history of oophorectomy were conducted. Fitted smoothing 
curves were also evaluated.
RESULTS: We found leukocyte telomere length was positively correlated with age 
at benign hysterectomy after adjusting for other confounders in both a minimally 
adjusted model [β = 4.18, 95%CI: (0.17,8.20)] and a fully adjusted model 
[β = 4.63, 95% CI:(0.56,8.70)].
CONCLUSIONS: Earlier age at benign hysterectomy was associated with shorter 
telomere length in a nationally representative population of women. These data 
provide new information in pre-surgical counseling and decision-making.

PURPOSE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an important biomarker of aging. The 
oxidative balance score (OBS) is used to assess the oxidative stress-related 
exposures of diet and lifestyle. This study is aimed at exploring if the OBS was 
associated with LTL.
METHODS: 3220 adults were included in this study from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. LTL was assayed from leukocyte 
DNA. Twenty dietary and lifestyle factors were selected to score the OBS. 
Survey-based multivariable linear regression was conducted to assess the 
association between the OBS and log-transformed LTL.
RESULTS: The association between the OBS and log-transformed LTL was positive in 
females but not males. For females, compared with the lowest OBS category as a 
reference, the multivariable-adjusted beta estimate (95% confidence interval, 
CI) for the highest OBS category was 0.0701 (0.0205-0.1197) (p for trend < 
0.01), and the multivariable-adjusted beta estimate (95% CI) of the continuous 
OBS was 0.0039 (0.0014-0.0065). There was also the gender difference in the 
correlations of the dietary OBS and the lifestyle OBS with log-transformed LTL.
CONCLUSION: There was a positive association between the OBS and LTL in females. 
This result suggested that diet and lifestyle might affect LTL by regulating 
oxidative balance.

BACKGROUND: Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes (BTEXs) are a group of 
aromatic air pollutants from fossil fuels. There is no research on associations 
of the BTEXs mixture with telomere length (TL), a marker of cellular aging, in 
the general population.
METHODS: We analyzed a subsample of 549 US adults aged 20-59 years from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000. BTEXs samples were 
collected by passive exposure badges worn by participants for 48-72 h. Levels of 
BTEXs were measured with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Leukocyte TL was 
measured with qPCR. We used Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) to examine 
the effect of the BTEXs mixture on TL adjusting for potential confounders. 
Analyses were stratified by tobacco smoking status (serum cotinine≥10 ng/mL vs. 
<10 ng/mL).
RESULTS: Levels of personal exposure to BTEXs were detectable in most 
participants and were relatively higher in the 150 smokers than in the 399 
nonsmokers. The BTEXs were moderately or strongly intercorrelated 
(0.5 < r ≤ 0.9, P < 0.05). All chemicals had weak, inverse correlations with TL 
(-0.1<r < 0, P > 0.05). In BKMR models among the nonsmokers, the BTEXs mixture 
was significantly inversely associated with TL at a low range of the BTEXs 
(20th-65th percentile) but was not associated with TL at a higher range (>65th 
percentile). Also, we found a U-shape association of benzene and a positive 
association of ethylbenzene with TL independent of other BTEXs. Among smokers, 
neither the BTEXs mixture nor any individual BTEXs were significantly associated 
with TL.
CONCLUSION: Within a low-to-middle range, exposure to the BTEXs mixture may be 
associated with shorter telomere length in the general nonsmoking population.

Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may influence telomere length 
(TL), which is considered as a marker of biological age associated with the risk 
of chronic disease. We hypothesized that dietary exposure to polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins could affect TL. Our aim was to evaluate the 
association of dietary exposure to PCBs and dioxins with TL. In this 
cross-sectional study of 886 subjects older than 55 y (mean age: 67.7; standard 
deviation (SD): 6.1; 27% women) from the "Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra" 
(SUN) project. TL was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction and dietary PCBs and dioxins exposure was collected using a validated 
136-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. Multivariable linear regression models 
were used to control for potential confounding factors. Shorter TL was 
associated with dietary total PCBs (SD of T/S ratio/(ng/day) = -0.30 × 10-7; 95% 
CI, -0.55 × 10-7 to -0.06 × 10-7), dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) (SD of T/S 
ratio/(pg WHO TEQ (Toxic Equivalents)/day) = -6.17 × 10-7; 95% CI, -11.30 × 10-7 
to -1.03 × 10-7), and total TEQ exposure (SD of T/S ratio/(pg WHO TEQ/day) = 
-5.02 × 10-7; 95% CI, -9.44 × 10-7 to -0.61 × 10-7), but not with dioxins (SD of 
T/S ratio/(pg WHO TEQ/day) = -13.90 × 10-7; 95% CI, -37.70 × 10-7 to 9.79 × 
10-7). In this sample of middle-aged and older Spanish adults, dietary exposure 
to total PCBs and DL-PCBs alone and together with dioxins was associated with 
shorter TL. Further longitudinal studies, preferably with POPs measured in 
biological samples, are needed to confirm this finding.

Background: Acculturation profiles and their impact on telomere length among 
foreign-born Hispanics/Latinos living in the United States (US) are relatively 
unknown. The limited research available has linked acculturation with shortened 
telomere length. Objectives: To identify acculturation profiles among a US 
representative sample of Hispanics/Latinos and to then examine telomere length 
differences between profiles. Methods: We conducted a latent class analysis 
among a non-institutionalized US-representative sample of Hispanics/Latinos 
using the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 
2,292). The latent variable of acculturation was assessed by length of time in 
the US and language used as a child, read and spoken, usually spoken at home, 
used to think, and used with friends (i.e., Spanish and/or English). Telomere 
length assessed from leukocytes was used as the distal continuous outcome. 
Results: We identified five profiles: (1) low acculturated [33.2% of sample]; 
(2) partially integrated [18.6% of sample]; (3) integrated [19.4% of sample]; 
(4) partially assimilated [15.1% of sample]; and (5) assimilated [13.7% of 
sample]. Acculturation profiles revealed nuanced differences in conditional 
probabilities with language use despite the length of time spent in the US. 
While telomere length did vary, there were no significant differences between 
profiles. Conclusion: Profiles identified revealed that possible life-course and 
generational effects may be at play in the partially assimilated and assimilated 
profiles. Our findings expand public health research using complex survey data 
to identify and assess the dynamic relationship of acculturation profiles and 
health biomarkers, while being among the first to examine this context using a 
person-centered approach.

Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is characterised by the concurrent presence of 
sarcopenia and excess adiposity. Telomere shortening has been associated with 
sarcopenia and obesity alone but the association between SO and telomere length 
(TL) has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate SO and TL in an 
adult population. Data were from 5397 individuals (mean age = 44.7 years, 51.3% 
male) enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Body 
composition (BC) was assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Two models 
were used to assess SO: a BC model including four phenotypes derived from the 
combination of high or low adiposity and muscle mass; and, a truncal fat mass to 
appendicular skeletal mass ratio (TrFM/ASM). TL was assessed using quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction and expressed as base pairs. The mean TL, relative to 
the reference DNA, was calculated and expressed as the mean T/S ratio. A General 
Linear Model was applied to determine associations between TL for SO. In 
adjusted analysis, only individuals with SO, defined as the presence of high 
adiposity-low muscle mass (four-phenotype model), had significantly shorter 
telomeres (p = 0.05) than the reference group (i.e. low adiposity-high muscle 
mass), with a mean T/S ratio of 1.02 (95%CI: 0.98-1.05) compared to 1.05 (95%CI: 
1.01-1.09), respectively. TrFM/ASM was not associated with TL. Preliminary 
findings suggest that sarcopenia and obesity may act synergistically to shorten 
telomeres.

INTRODUCTION: Mildly increased bilirubin concentration has a protective effect 
on oxidative stress-related diseases. However, it remains unknown whether 
elevated circulating bilirubin is associated with longer telomere length. The 
aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the association between total 
bilirubin concentration and telomere length.
METHODS: We used the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. The multivariable linear regression model was used to 
examine the association between total bilirubin concentration and telomere 
length. The nonlinear relationship was analyzed using a generalized additive 
model with the smoothing plot.
RESULTS: A total of 7818 participants with a mean age of 49.20 ± 18.82 years 
were included. Compared with the lowest concentration of total bilirubin (Q1), 
the highest quartile of total bilirubin concentration was associated with longer 
telomere length in male (β = 0.04, 95 CI%: 0.00, 0.07, P = 0.024) and female (β 
= 0.04, 95 CI%: 0.02, 0.04, P = 0.002). Furthermore, an inverted U-shaped 
relationship between total bilirubin and telomere length was found. On the left 
of turning points (total bilirubin < 0.5 mg/dL), total bilirubin concentration 
was positively associated with telomere length (β = 0.23, 95 CI%: 0.14, 0.32, P 
< 0.001). However, the association between total bilirubin concentration and 
telomere length was not significant (β = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.04, P = 0.346) 
above the turning point.
CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence based on a nationally representative 
survey demonstrating a positive and nonlinear association between total 
bilirubin concentration and telomere length. Future large-scale prospective 
studies are warranted to confirm our findings.

Physiologic aging leads to attrition of telomeres and replicative senescence. An 
acceleration of this process has been hypothesized in the progression of chronic 
liver disease. We sought to examine the association of telomere length (TL) with 
liver disease and its impact on mortality risk. A cohort of 7,072 adults with 
leukocyte TL measurements from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey 1999-2002 with mortality follow-up through 2015 was analyzed. Liver 
disease was defined by aminotransferase levels and classified into 
etiology-based and advanced fibrosis categories. Multivariable-adjusted linear 
regression models estimated effect sizes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 
of the presence of liver disease on TL. Cox regression models evaluated 
associations between TL and all-cause mortality risk using adjusted hazard 
ratios (HRs). The cohort was representative of the US population with mean age 
46.1 years and mean TL 5.79 kilobase pairs. No overall association between TL 
and liver disease was found; however, there was a significant negative 
association of TL and advanced liver fibrosis in individuals aged 65 and above. 
The liver disease cohort (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.99-1.51) and those with metabolic 
syndrome (HR 1.26, 95% CI 0.96-1.67) had increased mortality risk with shorter 
TL. The relationship between TL and all-cause mortality was stronger in women 
(HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.02-2.23) and in non-Hispanic Whites (HR 1.37, 95% CI 
1.02-1.84). Conclusion: Shortened leukocyte TL is independently associated with 
advanced liver disease at older ages, and with a higher risk of all-cause 
mortality in those with liver disease. These associations reaffirm the need to 
better understand the role of telomeres in the progression of liver disease.

Background: Recent studies have suggested a link between reproductive health and 
later-life chronic conditions, yet the mechanism remains unclear. One proposed 
mechanism is through chronic inflammation. The objective of this study was to 
examine the association between endometriosis and uterine fibroids and 
biomarkers of inflammation and cellular aging. Materials and Methods: We used 
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2342; 
1999-2002). Adjusted logistic and linear regression were used to examine the 
association between these two reproductive conditions and elevated C-reactive 
protein (CRP; >3.0 mg/L) and leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio), 
respectively. Given that a greater length of time spent with a condition may 
represent persistence of an inflammatory process, we further examined the 
association between time since disease diagnosis on telomere length among the 
subset of women with diagnosed endometriosis and fibroids. Results: Women with 
endometriosis had greater odds of having elevated CRP than those without 
endometriosis (OR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.45). Women with endometriosis had a 
shorter telomere length than women without endometriosis (-3.4, 95% CI: -7.3 to 
-0.3 in age-adjusted models and -2.9, 95% CI: -8.8 to 3.5 in fully adjusted 
models). Telomeres were 1% (95% CI: -1.2 to -0.6) shorter for every elapsed year 
since endometriosis diagnosis. No substantive patterns emerged between uterine 
fibroids and CRP or telomere length. Conclusions: Women with endometriosis (or a 
longer duration of time spent with endometriosis) had higher inflammatory 
markers and shorter mean telomere length. These results provide further insights 
into potential mechanisms linking endometriosis to chronic disease and 
later-life health.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of dynamic weight change in adulthood 
with leukocyte telomere length among U.S. adults.
METHODS: This study included 3,886 subjects aged 36-75 years from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 cycle. 
Survey-weighted multivariable linear regression with adjustments for potential 
confounders was utilized.
RESULTS: 3,386 individuals were finally included. People with stable obesity had 
a 0.130 kbp (95% CI: 0.061-0.198, P=1.97E-04) shorter leukocyte telomere length 
than those with stable normal weight (reference group) during the 10-year 
period, corresponding to approximately 8.7 years of aging. Weight gain from 
non-obesity to obesity shortened the leukocyte telomere length by 0.094 kbp (95% 
CI: 0.012-0.177, P=0.026), while normal weight to overweight or remaining 
overweight shortened the leukocyte telomere length by 0.074 kbp (95% CI: 
0.014-0.134, P=0.016). The leukocyte telomere length has 0.003 kbp attrition on 
average for every 1 kg increase in weight from a mean age of 41 years to 51 
years. Further stratified analysis showed that the associations generally varied 
across sex and race/ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that weight changes during a 10-year period was 
associated with leukocyte telomere length and supports the theory that weight 
gain promotes aging across adulthood.

PURPOSE: To examine whether there was an association of leucocyte telomere 
length (LTL) with all-cause, cardiovascular (CVD)- and cancer-specific mortality 
risks among U.S. adults; and whether these associations vary with race and 
ethnicity and age.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort using data from the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 to 2002 and the 2015 Linked Mortality 
File on adults 25 years or older (n = 6,526 and 1,753 deaths). Cox proportional 
hazards regression was used to quantify the association of LTL with each outcome 
adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. We 
tested a three-way interaction for LTL, race and ethnicity, and age groups.
RESULTS: After adjustment, the rate of dying for all-cause and CVD-specific 
mortality was at least 24% lower for a 1 kilobase increase in LTL. When compared 
with adults with the shortest telomere, the rates of dying were at least 17% 
lower for all-cause and CVD-specific mortality for those with longer telomere. 
For all-cause mortality, increase LTL was associated with lower rate of dying 
among non-Hispanic Blacks 45 years or older, and non-Hispanic Whites 65 years or 
older.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that increase telomere length was associated with lower 
all-cause and CVD-specific mortality rates among U.S. adults. For all-cause 
mortality, this association varies within racial and ethnic groups across age 
groups.

CONTEXT: Both obesity and inflammation are related to accelerated aging. It is 
not yet known whether inflammation mediates the effects of obesity on aging.
OBJECTIVE: This work aims to dissect the direct effect of body mass index (BMI) 
and its indirect effect through C-reactive protein (CRP) on leukocyte telomere 
length (LTL) to determine the mediation effect of CRP on the BMI-LTL 
association.
METHODS: The study cohort included 5451 adults (1404 Mexican American, 3114 
White, and 933 Black individuals; 53.5% male; mean age = 49.2 years) from the 
1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. General mediation 
models were used to examine the mediation effect of CRP on the BMI-LTL 
association.
RESULTS: After adjusting for age, race, sex, physical activity, alcohol use, and 
serum cotinine, the total effect of BMI on LTL was significant (standardized 
regression coefficient, β = -.054, P < .001) without CRP included in the model. 
With inclusion of CRP in the model, the indirect effect of BMI on LTL through 
CRP was estimated at β equal to -.023 (P < .001), and the direct effect of BMI 
on LTL in its absolute value decreased to β equal to -.031 (P = .025). The 
mediation effect of CRP was estimated at 42.6%. The mediation model parameters 
did not differ significantly between race and sex groups.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the inverse BMI-LTL association is partly 
mediated by obesity-induced inflammation. The significant direct effect of BMI 
on LTL with removal of the mediation effect through CRP indicates that obesity 
is associated with LTL attrition also through other noninflammatory mechanisms.

The relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and telomere length was 
examined using a cross-sectional design and an NHANES random sample of 5448 U.S. 
adults. Fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption was assessed using a 24 h recall, 
and telomere length, an index of cellular aging, was measured using the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Telomere length was linearly 
related to F&V intake when combined (F = 22.7, p < 0.0001) and also when 
separated as fruit (F = 7.2, p < 0.0121) or vegetables (F = 15.4, p < 0.0005), 
after adjusting for covariates. Specifically, telomeres were 27.8 base pairs 
longer for each 100 g (3.5 ounces) of F&V consumed. Because each additional year 
of chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 14.9 base pairs 
shorter, when women and men were analyzed together, results indicated that a 100 
g (3.5 oz) per day increment in F&V corresponded with 1.9 years less biological 
aging. When the 75th percentile of F&V intake was compared to the 25th, the 
difference was 4.4 years of cellular aging. When separated by sex, fruits and 
vegetables were both related to telomere length in women, but only vegetable 
intake was predictive of telomere length in men. In conclusion, evidence based 
on a random sample of U.S. adults indicates that the more the servings of F&V, 
the longer telomeres tend to be.

A growing body of literature on military personnel and veterans' health suggests 
that prior military service may be associated with exposures that increase the 
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which may differ by race/ethnicity. This 
study examined the hypothesis that differential telomere shortening, a measure 
of cellular aging, by race/ethnicity may explain prior findings of differential 
CVD risk in racial/ethnic groups with military service. Data from the first two 
continuous waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES), administered from 1999-2002 were analyzed. Mean telomere length in 
base pairs was analyzed with multivariable adjusted linear regression with 
complex sample design, stratified by sex. The unadjusted mean telomere length 
was 225.8 base shorter for individuals with prior military service. The mean 
telomere length for men was 47.2 (95% CI: -92.9, -1.5; p < 0.05) base pairs 
shorter for men with military service after adjustment for demographic, 
socioeconomic, and behavioral variables, but did not differ significantly in 
women with and without prior military service. The interaction between military 
service and race/ethnicity was not significant for men or women. The results 
suggest that military service may contribute to accelerated aging as a result of 
health damaging exposures, such as combat, injury, and environmental 
contaminants, though other unmeasured confounders could also potentially explain 
the results.

OBJECTIVE: Telomere length can be a biomarker of cumulative oxidative stress and 
inflammation indicating biological aging. Previous studies examined association 
of nutrient intake with telomere length targeting middle-aged and elderly 
individuals. This study examined whether dietary macro- and micronutrient intake 
was associated with telomere length in young females.
METHODS: Seventy-four Japanese young females (median (interquartile range) age 
was 19 (19 - 20) years) participated. We estimated their intake of nutrients 
(energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, essential elements, vitamins, fatty acids, 
and dietary fibre) using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and 
measured telomere length (T/S ratio, the ratio of telomere repeat copy number 
(T) to single-copy gene number (S)) of DNA extracted from blood by qPCR. The 
association between telomere length and tertiles of nutrient intake were 
analysed.
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) of telomere length was 0.70 
(0.52 - 0.98). Vitamin A intake was positively associated with telomere length 
(tertile 1 vs. 2, coefficient [95% confidence interval] = 0.42 [0.12, 0.71]; 
tertile 1 vs. 3, coefficient [95% confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.04, 0.62]) 
after adjusting for covariates (age, BMI, passive smoking, and drinking).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that variation in vitamin A intake might 
influence telomere attrition in healthy individuals.

BACKGROUND: A higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with shorter telomeres. 
The loss of muscle mass with aging is associated with adverse outcomes. The 
appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI) is currently used to quantify muscle 
mass.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of the ASMI with leukocyte telomere 
length in adult Americans.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 dataset. Body composition was measured by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Low muscle mass was defined using sex-specific 
thresholds of the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI). The 
telomere-to-single-copy gene ratio (T/S ratio) was converted to base pairs. 
Generalized linear models were performed to evaluate the association of ASMI 
with telomere length.
RESULTS: In multivariable adjustment regression models, higher ASMI was 
associated with longer telomeres in US adults (β = 70.2, P < 0.001, P 
trend<0.001). In participants with preserved muscle mass, the ASMI was related 
to longer telomere length (β = 75.1, P < 0.001), but not significantly in low 
muscle mass participants (β = 68.7, P = 0.30). Further subgroup analysis by a 
combination of age groups and muscle mass status showed positive association 
with young-preserved muscle mass (β = 82.6, P < 0.001), old-preserved muscle 
mass (β = 44.4, P = 0.12), young-low muscle mass (β = 135.4, P = 0.20), and 
old-low muscle mass (β = 52.7, P = 0.55). Because each additional year of 
chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 15.3 base pairs 
shorter, on average, this would equate to 5.4 fewer years of biological aging 
(82.6 ÷ 15.3) in the young-preserved muscle mass participants.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher ASMI is associated with longer telomeres. The prevention 
of skeletal muscle loss has the potential to delay telomere shortening and 
account for less biological aging.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a potential biological, mechanistic link for the 
well-established association between primary care access and reduced mortality, 
this study sought to measure the impact of having a usual source of health care 
on leukocyte telomere length (LTL).
DATA SOURCES: Our study population included 3202 participants aged 50 to 
84 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2001.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional Study. LTLs between people with and without a 
usual source of care were compared using unadjusted and adjusted linear 
regression models. Fully adjusted models accounted for demographic 
characteristics, health conditions, and health behaviors.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After controlling for individual factors, health conditions, 
and health behaviors, people who had a usual source of health care had 
significantly longer LTL (β = 89.8 base pairs, P-value = .005) compared with 
those without a usual source of care; corresponding to approximately 7 years of 
life.
CONCLUSIONS: Having a usual source of health care is associated with longer LTL 
among older adults. This study provides a potential biologic link for the noted 
association between primary care access and reduced mortality that has been 
observed at the individual and population level.

BACKGROUND: Age-related cognitive decline begins in middle age and persists with 
age. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) decreases with age and is enhanced by 
inflammation and oxidative stress. However, whether shorter LTL correlates with 
cognitive decline remains controversial.
AIMS: We aimed to investigate the relationship between LTL and cognitive decline 
in the American elderly.
METHODS: We used data from the 1999 to 2002 U.S. National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES). We included participants aged 65-80 with available 
data on LTL and cognitive assessments. The cognitive function assessment used 
the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). We applied multivariate modeling to 
estimate the association between LTL and cognitive performance. Additionally, to 
ensure robust data analysis, we converted LTL into categorical variables through 
quartile and then calculated the P for trend.
RESULTS: After adjusting for age, cardiovascular disease (CAD) score, gender, 
race, body mass index (BMI), and educational level, LTL showed a positive 
correlation with DSST score (odds ratio [OR] 3.47 [0.14, 6.79], P = 0.04). 
Additionally, to further quantify the LTL-DSST interaction, we found a similar 
trend when LTL was regarded as a categorical variable (quartile) (P for trend = 
0.03).
CONCLUSION: LTL was associated with cognitive capabilities among the elderly, 
implying that LTL might be a biomarker of cognitive aging.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental stressors can lead to shorter leukocyte 
telomere length and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Preservation of 
leukocyte telomere length by reducing oxidative stress exposure and reinforcing 
immunity may be a mechanism by which nutritional factors delay or prevent 
chronic disease development.
METHODS: Healthy pregnant women (aged 18-45 years) at 9-15 weeks of gestation 
living in Gasabo District, Kigali, Rwanda, were recruited from 10 health centers 
for a prospective, longitudinal study from September to October 2017 to 
determine possible associations between nutrition health, infectious disease and 
leukocyte telomere length. Anthropometric and laboratory measurements were 
performed using standard procedures; sociodemographic parameters and health 
histories were assessed via surveys, and leukocyte telomere length was assessed 
using quantitative PCR expressed as the ratio of a telomeric product to a 
single-copy gene product (T/S).
RESULTS: Mean gestational age of participants (n = 297) at enrollment was 
13.04 ± 3.50 weeks, age was 28.16 ± 6.10 years and leukocyte telomere length was 
1.16 ± 0.22 (T/S). Younger age; no schooling vs. primary schooling; and lower 
levels of ferritin, soluble transferrin receptors and retinol-binding protein 
were independent predictors of longer telomere length in multivariable models.
CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte telomere length is an indicator of biological aging in 
pregnant Rwandan women. Maternal micronutrient status, specifically lower 
ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor levels, and retinol-binding protein 
levels were associated with longer maternal telomere length in contrast with 
some studies from North America and Europe. There were no associations between 
inflammation and infectious disease status and maternal leukocyte telomere 
length. Further studies are needed to enhance our understanding of the interplay 
between maternal nutritional status and infectious disease in relation to 
leukocyte telomere length in developing countries.

Telomere integrity is influenced by oxidative stress. Also, inflammation-related 
factors, including nutritional factors, could modulate telomere integrity. The 
relationship between a posteriori-derived dietary patterns and telomere length 
(TL) has been scarcely investigated. Thus, our objective was to examine the 
association between empirically derived dietary patterns ascertained through 
principal component analysis (PCA) and TL in an older adult Spanish population. 
A total of 886 older adults (>55 years old; 645 males and 241 females) from the 
Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort were included in the study. TL 
was measured by monochrome multiplex real-time quantitative PCR. Age-adjusted TL 
was used for all analyses. Dietary patterns were identified by PCA based on 
thirty predefined candidate food groups collected from a validated 136-food 
items frequency questionnaire. Generalised linear models were fitted to obtain 
β-coefficients and their 95 % CI evaluating differences in TL between each of 
the four upper quintiles of adherence to dietary patterns and the lowest 
quintile. Sensitivity analyses by rerunning all multiple linear models under 
different stratifications were performed to evaluate the robustness of our 
results. Two major dietary patterns were empirically identified, Western dietary 
pattern (WDP) and Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP). After adjustment for 
potential confounders, longer TL was found among subjects in the highest 
quintile of MDP (β = 0·064; 95 % CI 0·004, 0·123). The WDP showed no significant 
association with TL. In conclusion, higher adherence to a posteriori-derived MDP 
was independently associated with longer telomeres in an older adult Spanish 
population of the SUN project.

OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if maternal age at 
birth of last child is associated with leukocyte telomere length in a nationally 
representative population of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,232 women from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to examine maternal age at last 
birth and telomere length, surveyed between 1999 and 2002. We included 
perimenopausal and postmenopausal women age 40 years and older. Maternal age at 
last live birth was self-reported, and leukocyte telomere length was measured 
using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We calculated least-squares 
geometric mean telomere length across categories of maternal age adjusted for 
age, race/ethnicity, number of live births, survey cycle, and history of 
hysterectomy or oophorectomy. P trend < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. For hypothesis-generation, we explored modification by reproductive 
and sociodemographic factors.
RESULTS: Maternal age at last birth was positively associated with telomere 
length: the multivariable-adjusted least-squares geometric mean leukocyte 
telomere length across categories of age at last birth (<25, 25-29, 30-34, 
35-39, ≥40 y) was 0.90, 0.93, 0.93, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively (P 
trend = 0.04). There was suggestive evidence this association may be restricted 
to those women with one or two live births or women who reported ever using oral 
contraceptives (P interaction <0.10 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: Later maternal age was associated with longer telomere length in a 
nationally representative population of women. These data provide new insight 
into the biological relationship between reproductive history and long-term 
health. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A662.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity 
is prevalent but its relation with leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a cellular 
aging biomarker, is unclear.
METHODS: Among 3,472 participants from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) cycle 1999-2000, LTL was measured with the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. H pylori IgG was measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and defined as seropositivity with an immune 
status ratio score > 0.9. We used linear regression models to examine the 
relation of H pylori IgG seropositivity with continuous LTL and logistic 
regression for the relation with short LTL (<10th percentile of the population 
distribution) adjusting for potential confounders. We stratified the analyses by 
a priori selected variables.
RESULTS: Population prevalence of H pylori IgG seropositivity was 31.5% in the 
overall population with higher prevalence found in those with older age, other 
races than non-Hispanic whites, lower education, and being born out of the 
United States. Continuous LTL was non-significantly shorter in those with 
H Pylori IgG seropositivity versus seronegativity (mean difference = -40.3 bp, 
95% CI: -112.4, 31.9). This difference was not significant after adjusting for 
potential confounders nor stratifying by potential effect modifiers. H Pylori 
IgG seropositivity was significantly associated with short LTL among the elderly 
(55-75 years, adjusted OR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.17, 7.99), but not in the overall 
population (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.81-2.02).
CONCLUSION: H Pylori IgG seropositivity was not associated with continuous LTL 
in the general population but may be associated with an excessively short LTL in 
the elderly.

BACKGROUND: This study examines the association of periodontitis with telomere 
length (TL) and effect modification by population characteristics.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 3,478 participants from the 1999 to 2002 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Probing depth, attachment loss, and 
bleed on probing (BOP, available for 1,973 participants only) were examined on 
the distal, mesial, or mid-facial site of each tooth in two randomly selected 
quadrants. We defined periodontitis severity according to the Centers for 
Disease Control/American Academy of Periodontology guideline. TL from leukocytes 
was measured with qPCR. We used linear and logistic regression to examine the 
adjusted association of different severity of periodontitis and BOP with 
continuous TL (bp) and dichotomized short TL (<median), respectively. To assess 
effect modification, we stratified the analyses by a priori selected population 
characteristics including sex, age, body weight status, smoking, and 
cardiometabolic comorbidity.
RESULTS: Moderate BOP (<10% bleeding sites) was significantly associated with a 
shorter continuous TL (β = -89.0, SE = 37.8). Moderate to severe periodontitis 
was significantly associated with 47% (95% confidence interval [IL], 1.04 to 
2.09) higher odds of shorter TL, compared with those with mild or no 
periodontitis. The association was stronger in those who were female (adjusted 
OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.83), overweight or obese (adjusted OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 
1.12 to 2.41), or had cardiometabolic comorbidities (adjusted OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 
1.38 to 3.29).
CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis was associated with TL, a biomarker of cellular 
aging. The association was stronger in females, overweight or obese, or those 
with cardiometabolic diseases. Treatment on periodontitis could potentially 
protect individuals from aging-related diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the relationship between adiposity and telomere 
length in the United States population. The objective of our research was to 
examine this relationship in a representative, socioeconomically and 
sex-specific, diverse racial/ethnic population in the United States.
METHODS: Body mass index (BMI), % total body fat (TBF) and waist circumference 
(WC) with leukocyte telomere length (LTL) were examined according to 
sex-specific race/ethnicity using separate adjusted multivariate linear 
regressions on a sample of 4,919 respondents aged 20-84 years from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey's 1999-2002 data.
RESULTS: LTL was shortened .41%, .44%, and .16% in African American (AA) women 
and was associated with increasing BMI, %TBF, and WC, (β:-.0041, 95%CI: -.0070, 
-.0012; P=.007; β:-.0044, 95% CI: -.0081, -.0007; P=.02; β:-.0016, 95%CI: 
-.0031, -.0001; P=.04, respectively). LTL was shortened .29% in White women and 
was associated with increasing %TBF (β:-.0029, 95%CI: -.0048, -.0009; P=.006). 
There were no associations among AA men, White men or Mexican American men and 
women.
CONCLUSIONS: LTL is associated with an obesity phenotype in AA women. Tailored 
intervention is needed to ameliorate the burden of excess adiposity and 
subsequent cellular aging.

Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease defined by the presence of 
endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. While its etiology is 
largely unknown, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation plays a major 
role. Our objective was to investigate the association between peripheral blood 
leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and endometriosis using data from two large 
population-based studies, the New England Case-Control Study (NEC; n = 877) and 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n = 2268). NEC 
control participants were identified through a combination of random digit 
dialing, drivers' license lists, and town resident lists. In NHANES, selection 
algorithms were used to identify a nationally representative sample. Blood 
samples and demographic, reproductive, and health-related information were 
available from both data sources. Endometriosis was defined as self-reported of 
physician-diagnosed endometriosis. LTL was measured using quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction. Multivariable logistic regression was used to 
calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association 
between LTL and endometriosis. Shorter LTL was associated with greater odds of 
history of endometriosis. In NEC, women with the shortest LTL tertile compared 
with the longest had a 2.5-fold greater odds of endometriosis (ORT3/T1 = 2.56, 
95% CI = 1.16-5.63; p value, test for linear trend = 0.02). The association was 
stronger among women who usually experienced moderate or severe menstrual pain 
(OR T3/T1 = 3.50, 95% CI = 1.12-10.97). In NHANES, the data suggested a similar 
but attenuated association (ORT3/T1 = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.85-1.96). The observed 
associations in NEC suggest that shorter LTL may be associated with greater odds 
of endometriosis. A better understanding of how LTL influences endometriosis 
risk could elucidate novel disease pathophysiology.

Obesity is associated with age-related health conditions and telomere attrition 
- a marker of cellular aging. Obesity is attributable to adverse modifiable 
lifestyle factors. Little is known about the mediation effect of lifestyle 
factors associated with the relationship between obesity and telomere length. 
Our objective was to examine this association in the US. Pack years smoked, 
drinking level per day, physical activity (PA) per week and diet based on 
Healthy Eating Index (HEI) were assessed as mediators associated with the 
relationship between adiposity measures and leukocyte telomere length (LTL); 
adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), % total body fat (TBF) and 
waist circumference (WC). Separate adjusted linear regressions and mediation 
analysis were conducted on a total of 4919 respondents aged 20-84 years using 
cross-sectional 1999-2002 data from the US National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey. Inadequate PA correlated with 1.28% shorter LTL and was a 
factor accounting for 35% of the relationship between BMI and LTL (β = -0.0128, 
95% CI = 0.0259, 0.0004, p = .05). Smoking 30-≥59 pack years correlated with 4% 
shorter LTL and accounted for 21% of the relationship between %TBF and LTL 
(β = -0.0386, 95% CI = -0.0742, -0.0030, p = .03). Improvement in diet 
correlated with 0.11% longer LTL and contributed 25% of the association between 
%TBF and LTL (β = 0.0011, 95%CI =0.0004, 0.0018, p = .01). Diet correlated with 
0.11% longer LTL and correspond to 28% of the relationship between WC and LTL 
(β = 0.0011, 95%CI = 0.0004, 0.0018, p = .03). Interventions to improve 
modifiable behaviors may ameliorate cellular aging and aging related health 
conditions due to obesity among US adults.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that telomere length has significantly 
relationship with different age-related diseases. However, the relationship 
between mean telomere length (MTL) and elevated blood pressure (BP) has been 
unclear. Therefore, the aim of the recent study was tried to explore the 
association of MLT with BP.
METHODS: There were 5,981 subjects from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surveys (NHANES, 1999-2002) was included in analysis. The MTL was 
measured using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and 
expressed in telomere-to-single copy gene (T/S) ratio and grouped into 
quartiles. Multivariate linear [expressed in beta and 95% confidence interval 
(CI)], logistic regression [odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI] analyses and smooth 
curve fitting were performed to evaluate the relationship between MTL, BPs and 
the likelihood of hypertension.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 45.2±17.3 years, including 2,923 
(48.9%) males. After adjusting for potential confounders, MLT was significantly 
related to the prevalence of hypertension (OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.94; 
P=0.04). Smooth curve fitting found a non-linear relationship between MTL, the 
levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and the prevalence of 
hypertension. The inflection points for the smooth curve of MLT were at 0.86, 
1.02 and 0.80 (T/S ratio) respectively. The betas (95% CIs) for SBP [-12.58 
(-20.07, -5.09), P<0.01 and 2.25 (0.07, 4.43), P=0.04] and DBP [4.88 (1.29, 
8.47), P<0.01 and -3.30 (-5.54, -1.06), P<0.01], and ORs (95% CIs) for the 
prevalence of hypertension [0.02 (0.001, 9.71), P=0.15 and 0.26 (0.026, 2.60), 
P=0.25] on the left and right of the inflection point, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that MTL was related with SBP, DBP and the 
odds of hypertension in a non-linear manner.

OBJECTIVES: Telomere shortening is a well-established marker of biological 
aging. Whether telomere erosion coincides with age-related increases in 
antinuclear antibody (ANA) seropositivity remains unknown. Our study aimed to 
determine the association between ANA seropositivity and shortened telomeres 
among 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
subjects.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 2,188 NHANES study 
participants with available ANA and telomere length data. ANA testing was 
performed using indirect immunofluorescence. Telomere lengths were measured via 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods. Applying appropriate sample 
weighting techniques, we used univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
methods to assess the association between shortened telomeres (i.e. lowest 
decile of the cohort) and ANA seropositivity.
RESULTS: ANAs were positive in 322 out of 2,188 (14.7%, 95% CI 13.3-16.3%) 
individuals. Subjects with shortened telomeres were more likely to be older 
(p<0.001), male (p=0.005), and have a cancer history (p<0.001). A higher 
proportion of non-Hispanic white participants (61.6% vs. 49.3%) and a lower 
proportion of non-Hispanic black participants (7.8% vs. 17.9%) had shortened 
telomeres (p<0.001). Shortened telomeres were not independently associated with 
ANA seropositivity (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.87-2.52, p=0.14). However, female sex (OR 
1.91, 95% CI 1.23-2.96, p=0.006), age ≥80 years (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.08-3.92, 
p=0.03), and African American race (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.00-2.51, p=0.05) were 
independent risk factors for ANA seropositivity. Neither sex nor race modified 
the relationship between ANA seropositivity and telomere length.
CONCLUSIONS: Telomere erosion does not appear to be responsible for age-related 
increases in the prevalence of ANA seropositivity.

Accelerated telomere attrition is related to various diseases, and multiple 
factors have been reported to influence telomere length. However, little 
attention has focused on the relationship between serum phosphate levels and 
mean telomere length. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship 
between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere length in the US general 
population. A total of 7,817 participants from the 1999-2002 NHANES were 
included. The association between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere 
length was investigated using regression models. A remarkably positive 
relationship between serum phosphate levels and mean telomere length emerged 
after adjustments were made for covariates. The adjusted β coefficient of serum 
phosphate levels for mean telomere length was 0.038 (95% confidence intervals 
(CIs), 0.022 to 0.095, p = 0.002). A longer telomere length was observed in 
participants with serum phosphate levels in the highest quartiles, and a 
dose-dependent association was observed. Our study demonstrated that higher 
quartiles of phosphate had a remarkable correlation with longer telomere length.

The length of telomeres is an objective measure of biologic ageing. This study 
evaluated the extent minutes of walking per week are associated with leukocyte 
telomere length (LTL) in a random sample of 5,823 U.S. adults. The investigation 
was cross-sectional and data were obtained from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). LTL was measured by the quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction method. Walking minutes was calculated from walking 
frequency and duration measures. Results showed that for each year of 
chronological age, telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter (P < 0.0001). With 
walking minutes and LTL treated as continuous variables, the relationship was 
quadratic, not linear (F = 11.2, P = 0.0023). With walking time divided into 
three categories, adults who performed ≥ 150 minutes of walking per week had 
longer telomeres than those who did no regular walking, and those who did some, 
but less than the recommendation (F = 5.0, P = 0.0137). Regular walkers were 
estimated to have a biologic ageing advantage associated with 6.5-7.6 years less 
biologic ageing compared to non-walkers, after adjusting for covariates. 
Additional investigations designed to study causality and the mechanisms 
associated with the walking and LTL relationship are needed.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggested that lifestyle factors including dietary 
habits may influence the telomere length which is a reliable marker of 
biological aging and predictor for chronic diseases. However, the role of 
dietary selenium intake in telomere length maintenance is rarely examined.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the relationship between dietary selenium intake and 
telomere length among middle-aged and older adults in America.
METHODS: A total of 3194 United States adults older than 45 years old were 
extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 
1999-2000 and 2001-2002. Leukocyte telomere length was measured using the 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Dietary selenium intake 
was assessed by a trained interviewer using 24-h dietary recall method. 
Generalized linear models were performed to evaluate the association of dietary 
selenium intake with telomere length. The restricted cubic spline analysis was 
used to further explore the nonlinear dose-response relationship between dietary 
selenium intake and telomere length.
RESULTS: After adjusting potential confounders, every 20 μg increase in dietary 
selenium intake was associated with 0.42% (95% CI: 0.02%, 0.82%) longer telomere 
length in all participants. In the subgroup analyses, dietary selenium intake 
was related to longer telomere length in females (Percentage change: 0.87%; 95% 
CI: 0.26%, 1.49%) and non-obese participants (Percentage change: 0.53%; 95% CI: 
0.04%, 1.02%), but not in males (Percentage change: 0.04%; 95% CI: -0.49%, 
0.57%) and obese participants (Percentage change: 0.21%; 95% CI: -0.47%, 0.91%). 
The restricted cubic spline analysis showed a linear association between dietary 
selenium intake and telomere length.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the increased dietary selenium intake was 
associated with longer telomere length among middle-aged and older adults in 
America. These findings require further corroboration from future prospective 
studies.

Leucocyte telomere length (LTL) has been reported to be linked to ageing, cancer 
and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to explore the association 
between LTL and CVD risk in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. 
Complex associations, including nonlinearity and interaction, were also 
examined. A total of 7,378 subjects from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 were collected. Telomere length was 
detected from DNA samples and expressed as the mean T/S ratio (telomere repeats 
per single-copy gene). We performed multiple logistic regression models and 
interactive analysis to explore the associations between LTL and CVD risk by 
adjusting for potential confounders. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to 
investigate the robustness of our results. Among all participants, LTL was 
associated with the risk of CVD (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.63~0.98, P = 0.033) in a 
linear manner rather than in a nonlinear manner (P = 0.874). Interaction effects 
of LTL with both education (P = 0.017) and hypertension (P = 0.007) were 
observed. Furthermore, using subgroup analyses, protective effects of LTL on CVD 
risk were found in females and in individuals who were college graduates or 
above, had serum cotinine >10 ng/ml, did not have hypertension, or had normal 
white blood cell levels. LTL is linearly inversely associated with CVD risk in 
the general population of the United States.

BACKGROUND: Organophosphate insecticides have been widely used for >30 years, 
and are reported to be associated with various age-related chronic diseases. 
While shortening of telomere length has been considered as a marker of cellular 
aging, only a few small studies have been conducted to examine any difference of 
telomere length in workers exposed to organophosphates versus controls. 
Epidemiologic studies of the dose-response associations between environmental 
organophosphate exposure and telomere length in the general population are few.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between levels of 
organophosphate insecticide exposure and telomere length in the general 
population.
METHODS: We analyzed data for 1724 participants aged 20 years or more from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. Organophosphate 
insecticide exposure was estimated using measures of urinary concentrations for 
3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY) and six non-specific dialkyl phosphate 
metabolites, e.g., diethyl thiophosphate (DETP). Multiple linear regression was 
conducted to assess the association between organophosphate exposure and 
telomere length.
RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic and physical factors and urinary 
creatinine, participants in the second quartile for urinary TCPY had 0.06 (95% 
CI: 0.02-0.10) T/S ratio shorter telomere length than those in the lowest 
quartile. By contrast, participants in the second and third tertiles of urinary 
DETP had 0.08 (95% CI: 0.02-0.14) and 0.06 (95% CI, 0.01-0.11) T/S ratio longer 
telomere length than those in the lowest tertile. For other five metabolites, 
there was no association with telomere length.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of environmental exposures to certain organophosphate 
insecticides may be linked to altered telomere length in adults in the general 
population. Although our findings may need to be replicated, we provide the 
first evidence that environmental exposure to organophosphates may contribute to 
the alteration of telomere length, which is potentially related to biological 
aging and to the development of various chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sex hormone concentrations and telomere length are 
age related responses of human body, while whether there is a direct relation 
between sex hormone and telomere length is uncertain. Therefore, we used the 
data of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to quantify 
their direct association.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 710 women aged 35-60 years and 539 men 
aged 20-85 years were included from two cycles of the NHANES (1999-2002). 
Telomere length relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio) was measured 
using quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Seven hormones in serum (5 
in men and 2 in women) were assayed. Logistic regressions were used to calculate 
the odds ratios to evaluate the telomere length-sex hormones association.
RESULTS: Men with vigorous physical activity (71.1%) and without history of 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and lipid-lowering drugs using tended to have 
a longer telomere length (all P-values < 0.05); while women with longer 
sedentary time, smaller pregnant or live birth, and with older ages of 
firth/last birth were likely with longer telomere length (all P-values < 0.05). 
After adjusted for potential confounders, only anti-Mullerian hormone was 
positively and stably associated with short leukocytes telomere length in men 
(OR: 1.098; 95% CI: 1.034, 1.165). We did not detect any significant association 
of short telomere length with sex hormones in men and women. Discussion and 
Implications: Serum anti-Mullerian hormone in men was positively and stably 
associated with telomere length. More large-scaled and well-designed prospective 
studies are warranted to reconfirm our conclusions.

OBJECTIVES: The association between telomeres length (TL) and cancer mortality 
is uncertain. We tested the hypotheses that long TL are associated with reduced 
cancer mortality.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES, 1999-2002).
PARTICIPANTS: The analytic sample included adults (n = 7183) who had TL 
measurements.
MEASUREMENTS: DNA was obtained via blood samples. Telomere length was assessed 
using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.
RESULTS: During follow-up (0.08-12.7 person-years, median = 9.5 years), we 
observed 195 participants had cancer as causes of death. TL was negatively 
corelated with age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
C-reactive protein (CRP), race, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD) and cancer mortality, conversely, positively corelated with alcohol use, 
but not related to diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and smoking. Kaplan-Meier 
analysis revealed that TL was significantly associated with cancer mortality 
(log-rank, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study expands upon previous evidence of a relationship between 
TL and cancer mortality. TL may be a useful tool for evaluating risk of cancer 
mortality in American adults.

Socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have been associated with poor 
health outcomes. Little is known about the biological mechanism by which 
deprived neighborhood conditions exert negative influences on health. Data from 
the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were 
used to assess the relationship between neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) and 
log-transformed leukocyte telomere length (LTL) via multilevel modeling to 
control for census tract level clustering. Models were constructed using 
tertiles of NDI (ref = low NDI). NDI was calculated using census tract level 
socioeconomic indicators from the 2000 U.S. Census. The sample (n = 5,106 
adults) was 49.8% female and consisted of 82.9% non-Hispanic whites, 9.4% 
non-Hispanic blacks, and 7.6% Mexican Americans. Mean age was 45.8 years. 
Residents of neighborhoods with high NDI were younger, non-white, had lower 
educational attainment, and had a lower poverty to income ratio (all 
p < 0.0001). Neighborhood deprivation was inversely associated with LTL among 
individuals living in neighborhoods with medium NDI (β = -0.043, SE = 0.012, 
p = 0.0005) and high NDI (β = -0.039, SE = 0.013, p = 0.003). Among men, both 
medium (β = -0.042, SE = 0.015, p = 0.006) and high (β = -0.047, SE = 0.015, 
p = 0.001) NDI were associated with shorter LTL. Among women, only medium NDI 
(β = -0.020, SE = 0.016, p = 0.009) was associated with shorter LTL. After 
controlling for individual characteristics, including individual-level 
socioeconomic status, increasing neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation is 
associated with shorter LTL among a nationally representative sample of US 
adults. This suggests that telomere shortening may be a mechanism through which 
neighborhood deprivation results in poor health outcomes.

Milk Fat Intake and Telomere Length in U.S. Women and Men: The Role of the Milk 
Fat Fraction.

The associations between milk intake frequency and milk fat consumption and 
telomere length, an index of biological aging, were studied using an NHANES 
sample of 5,834 U.S. adults and a cross-sectional design. The milk consumption 
variables were assessed with the NHANES Diet Behavior and Nutrition 
questionnaire. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to 
measure leukocyte telomere length. Results showed that milk consumption 
frequency was not related to telomere length; however, there was a strong 
association between milk fat intake and telomere length. With the sample 
delimited to milk drinkers only, milk fat intake was linearly and inversely 
related to telomere length, after adjusting for the covariates (F = 8.6, P = 
0.0066). For each 1 percentage point increase in milk fat consumed (e.g., 1% to 
2%), adults had more than 4 years of additional biological aging. With milk fat 
intake divided into 5 categories (i.e., milk abstainers, nonfat, 1%, 2%, and 
full-fat milk), mean telomere lengths differed across the categories (F = 4.1, P 
= 0.0093). The mean telomere difference between the extremes of milk fat intake 
(nonfat vs. full-fat) was 145 base pairs, representing years of additional 
biological aging for full-fat milk consumers. Effect modification testing 
indicated that the milk fat and cellular aging association may be partly due to 
saturated fat intake differences across the milk fat groups. When the sample was 
delimited to adults reporting only high total saturated fat intake (tertile 3), 
the milk fat and telomere relationship was strong. However, when the sample was 
restricted to adults reporting only low saturated fat consumption (tertile 1), 
there was no relationship between milk fat intake and telomere length. Overall, 
the findings highlight an association of increased biological aging in U.S. 
adults who consumed high-fat milk. The results support the latest Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans (2015-2020), which recommend consumption of low-fat 
milk, but not high-fat milk, as part of a healthy diet.

Serum and Dietary Folate and Vitamin B(12) Levels Account for Differences in 
Cellular Aging: Evidence Based on Telomere Findings in 5581 U.S. Adults.

Folate and vitamin B12 are essential for a variety of metabolic processes. Both 
micronutrients have been shown to reduce oxidative stress significantly. The 
present cross-sectional investigation evaluated the association between serum 
and dietary folate and vitamin B12 levels and leukocyte telomere length, an 
index of cellular aging influenced by oxidative stress. The study included 5581 
adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 
Because participants were randomly selected, results are generalizable to all 
civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. A blood draw provided DNA and serum 
folate and B12 information. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction method 
was used to measure telomere length. The Bio-Rad Quantaphase II folate and 
vitamin B12 radioassay kit was used to quantify levels of folate and vitamin 
B12. Dietary folate and vitamin B12 were assessed using a multipass 24 h recall. 
In some models, age, race, smoking pack-years, alcohol use, body mass index, 
total physical activity, hours fasted before the blood draw, and diabetes status 
were employed as covariates to minimize their influence. Findings showed that 
for each additional year of chronological age, telomeres were 15.6 base pairs 
shorter, on average (F = 378.8, p < 0.0001). Men had shorter telomeres than 
women after adjusting for all the covariates (F = 6.8, p = 0.0146). Serum (F = 
10.5, p = 0.0030) and dietary (F = 5.0, p = 0.0325) folate concentrations were 
each linearly related to telomere length in women, but not in men, after 
controlling for age and race. Serum vitamin B12 and telomere length had a 
nonsignificant, inverse relationship in women, with age and race controlled (F = 
2.8, p = 0.1056), but no relation in men. Dietary vitamin B12 was linearly 
related to telomere length in women, after adjusting for age and race (F = 4.3, 
p = 0.0468), but not in men. Overall, evidence indicates that folate and vitamin 
B12 levels, especially folate, account for meaningful differences in cell aging 
in women, but not in men.

Mean telomere length (MLT) is a marker of cell aging and may associate with 
age-related diseases. However, the relationship between MLT and mortality risk 
remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the relationship between MLT and 
all-cause, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular mortality among adults in United 
States. We analyzed data were from National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES, 1999-2002) with follow-up data through 31 December 2015. Based 
on MLT, participants were categorized into low, middle and high groups. 
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, subgroup analysis and 
generalized additive model (GAM) were performed by using hazard ratios (HRs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 7827 participants were included in 
analysis (48.18% male). After 158.26 months of follow-up on average, there were 
1876 (23.97%), 87 (1.11%) and 243 (3.10%) onset of all-cause, cerebrovascular 
and cardiovascular mortality. After adjustment for potential confounders, using 
the low group as the reference, HRs for all-cause (0.87 and 0.86), 
cerebrovascular (0.75 and 0.75) and cardiovascular mortality (1.01 and 0.69) for 
the middle to high groups were not statistically significant (all P>0.05 for 
trend). MLT was non-linearly related to all-cause mortality but not to 
cerebrovascular and cardiovascular mortality. It was the first study to 
demonstrate the non-linear relationship between MLT and all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUND: Frailty and short telomere length, which address different aspects 
of biological aging, are separately associated with mortality in older adults.
AIMS: To evaluate whether the combination of these two biomarkers would be a 
better predictor of mortality than either alone.
METHODS: This present study included participants 60 years of age or older from 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the 1999-2002 phase. The 
frailty phenotype was identified based on the Fried definition. Telomere length 
relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio) was assessed using quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cox proportional hazards regression models were 
used to estimate the individual and combined effects of frailty phenotype and 
telomere length on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: Compared with participants with neither impairment, the mortality risks 
increased slightly among participants with short telomere length only (hazard 
ratio [HR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.42) or pre-frailty only 
(HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.80-2.60) and gradually elevated approximately 3 folds with 
both short telomere length and pre-frailty (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.81-2.74) or 
frailty (HR 3.57, 95% CI 2.56-4.98). Moreover, participants with both short 
telomere length and frailty had the highest increased all-cause mortality (HR 
5.16, 95% CI 3.38-7.85) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 4.67, 95% CI 
2.02-10.82).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The combined predictor had more capability of 
predicting mortality, which suggested that integrating both molecular biomarkers 
and physiological functional parameters would be a more informative measure of 
biological aging.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the decline in telomere length (TL) with 
age and evaluate effect modification by gender, chronic stress, and comorbidity 
in a representative sample of the US population.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data on 7826 adults with a TL measurement, were 
included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, years 
1999-2002. The population rate of decline in TL across 10-year age categories 
was estimated using crude and adjusted regression.
RESULTS: In an adjusted model, the population rate of decline in TL with age was 
consistent and linear for only three age categories: 20-29 (β = -0.0172, 95% CI: 
-0.0342, -0.0002), 50-59 (β = -0.0182, 95% CI: -0.0311, -0.0054) and 70-79 (β = 
-0.0170, 95% CI: -0.0329, -0.0011) years. The population rate of decline in TL 
with age was significantly greater for males and those with high allostatic load 
and a history of comorbidities. When the population rate of decline in TL was 
analyzed by gender in 10-year age bins, a fairly consistent yet statistically 
non-significant decline for males was observed; however, a trough in the rate 
was observed for females in the age categories 20-29 years (β = -0.0284, 95% CI: 
-0.0464, -0.0103) and 50-59 years (β = -0.0211, 95% CI: -0.0391, -0.0032). To 
further elucidate the gender difference observed in the primary analyses, 
secondary analyses were conducted with reproductive and hormonal status; a 
significant inverse association was found between TL and parity, menopause, and 
age at menopause.
CONCLUSIONS: TL was shorter with increasing age and this decline was modified by 
gender, chronic stress and comorbidities; individuals with chronic morbidity 
and/or chronic stress and females in their twenties and fifties experienced 
greater decline. Female reproductive factors, i.e., parity and menopause, were 
associated with TL.

BACKGROUND: Numerous methods exist to analyze complex environmental mixtures in 
health studies. As an illustration of the different uses of mixture methods, we 
employed methods geared toward distinct research questions concerning persistent 
organic chemicals (POPs) as a mixture and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) as an 
outcome.
METHODS: With information on 18 POPs and LTL among 1,003 U.S. adults (NHANES, 
2001-2002), we used unsupervised methods including clustering to identify 
profiles of similarly exposed participants, and Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify common exposure 
patterns. We also employed supervised learning techniques, including penalized, 
weighted quantile sum (WQS), and Bayesian kernel machine (BKMR) regressions, to 
identify potentially toxic agents, and characterize nonlinear associations, 
interactions, and the overall mixture effect.
RESULTS: Clustering separated participants into high, medium, and low POP 
exposure groups; longer log-LTL was found among those with high exposure. The 
first PCA component represented overall POP exposure and was positively 
associated with log-LTL. Two EFA factors, one representing furans and the other 
PCBs 126 and 118, were positively associated with log-LTL. Penalized regression 
methods selected three congeners in common (PCB 126, PCB 118, and furan 
2,3,4,7,8-pncdf) as potentially toxic agents. WQS found a positive overall 
effect of the POP mixture and identified six POPs as potentially toxic agents 
(furans 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hxcdf, 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hxcdf, and PCBs 
99, 126, 169). BKMR found a positive linear association with furan 
2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, suggestive evidence of linear associations with PCBs 126 and 
169, and a positive overall effect of the mixture, but no interactions among 
congeners.
CONCLUSIONS: Using different methods, we identified patterns of POP exposure, 
potentially toxic agents, the absence of interaction, and estimated the overall 
mixture effect. These applications and results may serve as a guide for mixture 
method selection based on specific research questions.

The influence of smoking exposure on telomere length with a focus on the impact 
of race has rarely been discussed. We performed a cross sectional analysis into 
the associations of smoking indicators with leukocyte telomere length (LTL) by 
race among 5864 nationally representative sample of US adults (≥20 years). Data 
from 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was used for 
the analysis. Smoking indicators were assessed by interviews and serum cotinine 
levels. LTL was quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Multiple linear 
regressions were used to assess the association with adjustment for covariates, 
sample weights and design effects separately for Whites, Blacks and Mexican 
Americans. The intensity of smoking, measured by the average number of 
cigarettes consumed per day, was negatively associated with LTL among Whites (β: 
-3.87, 95% CI: -5.98 to -1.21) and among Blacks (β: -15.46, 95% CI: -29.79 to 
-2.12) participants. Compared with cotinine level < 0.05 ng/ml, cotinine level 
≥3 ng/ml was associated with shorter LTL (β: -77.92, 95% CI = -143.05 to -11.70) 
among Whites, but not among Blacks. We found increased number of cigarette 
consumption to be associated with shorter LTL in both Blacks and Whites, 
indicating that the impact of smoking on life-shortening diseases could partly 
be explained by telomere biology. Increased cotinine concentration however, was 
associated with shorter LTL only among Whites, not among Blacks. This 
differential relationship that we observed may have implications in interpreting 
cotinine as an objective biomarker of smoking exposure across races and warrant 
additional prospective investigation.

PURPOSE: Short telomeres and B vitamin deficiencies have been proposed as risk 
factors for age-related diseases and mortality that interact through oxidative 
stress and inflammation. However, available data to support this concept are 
insufficient. We aimed to investigate the predictive role of B vitamins and 
homocysteine (HCY) for mortality in cardiovascular patients. We explored 
potential relationships between HCY, B vitamins, relative telomere length (RTL), 
and indices of inflammation.
METHODS: Vitamin B6, HCY, interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitive-C-reactive 
protein (hs-CRP), and RTL were measured in participants of the Ludwigshafen Risk 
and Cardiovascular Health Study. Death events were recorded over a median 
follow-up of 9.9 years.
RESULTS: All-cause mortality increased with higher concentrations of HCY and 
lower vitamin B6. Patients in the 4th quartile of HCY and vitamin B6 had hazard 
ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality of 2.77 (95% CI 2.28-3.37) and 0.41(95% CI 
0.33-0.49), respectively, and for cardiovascular mortality of 2.78 (95% CI 
2.29-3.39) and 0.40 (95% CI 0.33-0.49), respectively, compared to those in the 
1st quartile. Multiple adjustments for confounders did not change these results. 
HCY and vitamin B6 correlated with age-corrected RTL (r = - 0.086, p < 0.001; 
r = 0.04, p = 0.031, respectively), IL-6 (r = 0.148, p < 0.001; r = - 0.249, 
p < 0.001, respectively), and hs-CRP (r = 0.101, p < 0.001; r = - 0.320, 
p < 0.001, respectively). Subjects with the longest telomeres had a 
significantly higher concentration of vitamin B6, but lower concentrations of 
HCY, IL-6, and hs-CRP. Multiple regression analyses identified HCY as an 
independent negative predictor of age-corrected RTL.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin B6 deficiency are 
risk factors for death from any cause. Hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin B6 
deficiency correlate with increased mortality. This correlation might, at least 
partially, be explained by accelerated telomere shortening induced by oxidative 
stress and systemic inflammation in these circumstances.

Little is known about the associations of inflammation and depression with 
telomere length. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002, the current study assessed the effects of 
inflammation and depression on telomere length in 1141 young adults in the USA. 
Depression status was assessed from the World Health Organization Composite 
International Diagnostic Interview and inflammation status was measured based on 
C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Information on telomere length was 
obtained using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method to measure 
telomere length relative to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Unadjusted and 
adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the 
relationship between the tertiles of CRP concentration and the telomere length 
stratified by the status of depression such as major depression or depressed 
affect vs. no depression. The adjusted models were controlled for age, family 
poverty income ratio, race/ethnicity, marital status, physical activity, body 
mass index, and alcohol drinking status. A significant and decreasing linear 
trend in telomere length was found as CRP levels increased in men, regardless of 
the depression status, and women with major depression or depressed affect (p 
values < 0.05). Among men without depression, those with an elevated CRP level 
had increased odds of having a shortened telomere length compared to men with 
low CRP levels after controlling for covariates (adjusted odds ratio 1.77, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.90). In women, there was no association between 
CRP and telomere length, regardless of the depression status. In conclusion, 
there was a significant and inverse association between inflammation and 
telomere length according to the depression status in men but not in women. The 
present findings may be of clinical significance for the monitoring of 
inflammation levels and depression status as determinants of telomere length.

PURPOSE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker of inflammation and 
oxidative stress that predicts chronic disease risk. Nutritional factors are 
related to LTL in adulthood, but these associations are not well characterized 
in children. We examined whether micronutrient status biomarkers were associated 
with LTL in school-age children.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 330 boys and 393 girls aged 
5-12 years from Bogotá, Colombia. We quantified blood concentrations of 
hemoglobin, ferritin, zinc, vitamin A, folate, and vitamin B-12; and measured 
LTL using qPCR in DNA extracted from buffy coat. We estimated mean differences 
in LTL by quartiles of micronutrient status biomarkers and categories of 
relevant sociodemographic and anthropometric covariates with the use of linear 
regression.
RESULTS: In girls, plasma vitamin B-12 was positively associated with LTL 
(adjusted LTL difference between extreme vitamin B-12 quartiles = 0.11; P, 
trend = 0.02). LTL was also positively associated with birth order in girls (P, 
trend = 0.02). In boys, LTL was not related to the micronutrient status 
biomarkers but, unexpectedly, it was positively associated with birth weight 
(P = 0.02), height-for-age Z score (P, trend = 0.01), and serum C-reactive 
protein (P, trend = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: LTL is associated with vitamin B-12 status among girls. LTL is also 
associated with birth weight, height, and C-reactive protein in boys.

Telomeres contain TTAGGG (T; Thymine, A; Adenine and G; Guanine) repetitive 
sequences and are placed at the end of human chromosomes. Telomere dysfunction 
is implicated in some age-related and chronic diseases, but its association with 
total serum lipids and obesity is unknown. Our objective was to determine 
influenced of total serum lipids on leukocyte telomere lengths (TLs). 
Participants were selected by cluster sampling from 22 districts of Tehran. The 
questionnaires were completed by 500 subjects and after the initial assessment 
in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, home, and job, 300 healthy people, aged 25-40 
years were finally selected. TLs and serum level of total lipids were measured 
by quantitative real-time PCR and the Phillips method, respectively. The average 
telomere length (T/S) and total lipids were 1.05 ± 0.3 mg/dl and 643.3 ± 70.8 
mg/dl, respectively. We found that a one unit difference in the following 
parameters were associated with kilo base pair differences in TL: Age -0.0002 
(95% CI [-0.0022, -0.0018]), BMI -0.0019 (95% CI [-0.0003, -0.0034]), TC 0.0001 
(95% CI [-0.0006, -0.0007]), TG -0.0010 (95% CI [-0.0015, -0.0004]), PL 0.0001 
(95% CI [-0.0005, -0.0007]), and TSL -0.0003 (95% CI [-0.0008, 0.0001]). 
Spearman correlation analysis revealed an inverse relationship between TC (R = 
-0.53; 95% CI [-0.61, -0.44]), TG (R = -0.50; 95% CI [-0.58, -0.41]), PL (R = 
-0.46; 95% CI [-0.54-0.36]), and TSL (R = -0.63; 95% CI [-0.69, -0.56]) with 
T/S. Our research suggests that the inverse relationship was found between TL 
and weight, BMI, age, and TSL which were associated with obesity. High serum 
lipids concentration may be associated with systemic inflammation and 
atherosclerosis and may lead to oxidative stress, resulting in telomere 
shortening.

BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the correlation between lipoproteins and telomere 
length in US adults is limited. We aimed to investigate whether lipoproteins was 
associated with telomere length using US National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) database.
METHODS: A total of 6468 selected participants were identified in the NHANES 
Data Base (1999-2002). The independent and dependent variables were lipoproteins 
and telomere length, respectively. The covariates included demographic data, 
dietary data, physical examination data, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: In fully-adjusted model, we found that 0.1 differences of telomere 
length were positively associated with HDL-C [0.19 (95% CI 0.07, 0.31)], while 
the associations between LDL-C [0.19 (95% CI -0.27, 0.65)], TG [- 1.00 (95% CI 
-2.09, 0.07) and telomere length were not detected. By nonlinearity test, only 
the relationship between HDL-C and telomere length was nonlinear. The inflection 
point we got was 1.25. On the left side of the inflection point (telomere 
length ≤ 1.25), a difference in 0.1 of telomere length was associated with 0.50 
difference in HDL-C.
CONCLUSION: After adjusting for demographic data, dietary data, physical 
examination data, and comorbidities, telomere length is not associated with 
LDL-C and TG, but is positively associated with HDL-C when telomere length is 
less than 1.25.

Association between Body Iron Status and Leukocyte Telomere Length, a Biomarker 
of Biological Aging, in a Nationally Representative Sample of US Adults.

Liu B, Sun Y, Xu G, Snetselaar LG, Ludewig G, Wallace RB, Bao W.

BACKGROUND: Excess iron levels can induce oxidative stress and could therefore 
affect telomere attrition. However, little is known about the impact of body 
iron status on telomere length.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the association between serum ferritin 
concentrations, an indicator of body iron status, and leukocyte telomere length 
in US adults.
DESIGN: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. We included 7,336 adults aged 20 years or 
older who had available data on serum ferritin levels and telomere length. High 
ferritin levels were defined as a serum ferritin level >200 ng/mL (449.4 pmol/L) 
in women and >300 ng/mL (674.1 pmol/L) in men. Low ferritin levels were defined 
as a serum ferritin level <30 ng/mL (67.4 pmol/L).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Leukocyte telomere length was assayed using the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Linear regression with survey weights was performed to 
estimate the association between serum ferritin levels and telomere length.
RESULTS: The prevalence of adults with high and low serum ferritin levels was 
10.9% and 17.6%, respectively. High ferritin levels were inversely associated 
with telomere length compared to normal ferritin levels. After adjustment for 
demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, body mass index, C-reactive 
protein, and leukocyte cell type composition, the β coefficient for 
log-transformed telomere length was -0.020 (standard error [SE]=0.009; P=0.047). 
The association was stronger in adults aged 65 years or older (β coefficient 
-0.081, SE=0.017; P<0.001) than in adults 20 to 44 years old (β coefficient 
-0.023, SE=0.019; P=0.24) or adults aged 45 to 64 years old (β coefficient 
0.024, SE=0.015; P=0.10) (P for interaction 0.003). Low ferritin levels were not 
significantly associated with telomere length compared with normal ferritin 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: In a US nationally representative population, high body iron status 
was associated with shorter telomeres, especially in adults aged 65 years or 
older.

Exposure to some environmental chemicals is reportedly associated with the 
leucocyte telomere length (LTL), but the effects of the non-occupational 
exposure to polyfluoroalkyl chemical (PFCs) on the LTL are not well understood. 
Using data from 773 participants in the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted in 1999-2000, we analysed the association 
between blood PFC concentrations and LTL. Coefficients (betas) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the blood PFC concentrations in association with 
the LTL were estimated using multivariate linear regression models after 
adjustment for age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), poverty income ratio, 
educational level, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein and other PFCs. 
The results identified a strong positive association between the blood 
perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) concentration and LTL in adults, and no 
associations were found between the LTL and other PFCs. In the linear regression 
models, each increment of one standard deviation (SD) in the 
base-10-logarithm-transformed PFOS concentration was associated with a 21-bp 
increase in the LTL in the fully adjusted model (P = 0.033). Moreover, serum 
PFOS was associated with the LTL mainly in females and individuals aged 40-50, 
as demonstrated by stratified analyses. These results provide epidemiological 
evidence showing that environment-related levels of serum PFOS are positively 
associated with the LTL in adults.

AIMS: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) accelerates atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and accordingly is the most potent hereditary 
cause of premature coronary heart disease. The association between telomere 
length (TL), a biological index of ageing, and FH has not been hitherto 
investigated. We addressed this question using data from the US National Health 
and Education National Surveys (NHANES, 1999-2002).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We included individuals, who had TL measurements (with 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction method) and a phenotypic diagnosis of FH 
based on the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria. Sample weights were 
applied for unequal probabilities of selection, non-response bias, and 
oversampling by complex sample analysis. The adult prevalence of FH in NHANES 
was 0.43% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.33-0.57]. The frequencies of 
probable FH (mean DLCN score: 6.2) and definite FH (mean DLCN score: 8.9) were 
0.42% (95% CI 0.32-0.48) and 0.03% (95% CI 0.02-0.06), respectively. Subjects 
with FH had a higher prevalence of non-communicable diseases (hypertension, 
diabetes 2 type, and obesity) and early atherosclerosis (2.9% in overall 
population vs. 42.2% in FH). Overall, the mean TL in the non-FH population was 
1.09 (95% CI 1.06-1.12) (T/S ratio) and 1.09 (95% CI 1.03-1.12) [(T/S ratio) for 
total FH]. Telomere length adjusted for age, sex, race, and body mass index was 
shorter in FH compared with healthy subjects (FH 0.89, 95% CI 0.84-0.93 vs. 
healthy: 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.11 T/S ratio; P < 0.001). Subjects with longer TL 
(highest quartile) had 12% less chance of having FH compared with those with TL 
in the lowest quartile (Q1, 95% CI 0.78-0.93).
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest an association between TL, an index 
of biological age, and the presence of FH, the most common inherited cause of 
premature ASCVD. Given our relatively low sample size, the findings need 
confirmation in larger studies.

Background: Telomere is regarded as the fundamental aspect of cellular aging and 
copper is recognized as one of the most essential trace elements. The role of 
dietary copper intake in telomere length maintenance is seldom examined. This 
study aims to investigate if telomere length is to be associated with daily 
dietary copper intake. Methods: We used epidemiological data from a large 
national population-based health and nutrition survey. Dietary intake was 
assessed during the 24-h period before the interview date when blood sample was 
collected. Telomere length was measured from blood leukocyte using PCR method. 
The relationship between telomere length and dietary copper intake was assessed 
using multivariable linear regression models. We also examined if obesity, 
measured by body mass index, could modify the observed association. Results: 
There are 7,324 participants had both leukocyte telomere length measured and 
dietary copper intake assessed, around 48.0% of them were men. Telomere length 
was longer in women than that in men (1.05 ± 0.26 vs. 1.00 ± 0.26 T/S ratio), 
while dietary copper intake was less in women than that in men (1.12 ± 0.80 vs. 
1.51 ± 1.61 mg). After controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, physical activity, 
current smoking status, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and body mass 
index in the multivariable linear regression models, one unit increase of 
log-transformed dietary copper intake was significantly associated with longer 
telomere length (β = 0.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.01, 0.04). We did not find 
a significant sex difference for this association. Conclusions: Dietary copper 
intake was significantly associated telomere length.The role of copper in human 
health might be involved in biological aging process.

BACKGROUND: To examine the association between serum concentrations of 
antioxidant and telomere length (TL) in U.S adults.
METHODS: Participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) with data available on TL measures from 2001 to 2002 were included. 
Serum lipophilic antioxidants level was measured using high performance liquid 
chromatography with photodiode array detection. We used analysis of co-variance 
and multivariable-adjusted linear regression models, accounting for the survey 
design and sample weights.
RESULTS: Of the 5992 eligible participants, 47.5% (n = 2844) were men. The mean 
age was 46.9 years overall, 47.2 years in men and 46.6 in women (p = 0.071). In 
age, sex, race, education, marital status, adiposity, smoking, C-reactive 
protein adjusted linear regressions, antioxidant, serum α-carotene, 
trans-β-carotene, cis- β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and combined 
Lutein/zeaxanthin were positively and significantly associated with TL (all 
p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a possible positive association between serum 
concentrations of lipophylic antioxidant and TL. The implications of this 
association deserve further investigation.

Aging is the biggest risk factor for the development of chronic diseases. 
Telomere length may represent one important mechanism by which dietary intake 
influences risk of age-related diseases; however, it is unknown which diet 
pattern is most strongly related to telomere length. We compared the 
relationships between 4 evidence-based diet quality indices and leukocyte 
telomere length in a nationally representative sample of healthy adults, and the 
extent to which these associations differed between men and women. Data on 4,758 
adults aged 20-65 years with no prior diagnosis of major chronic disease were 
obtained from the 1999-2002 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey. Diet was assessed using one 24-hour dietary recall. After 
adjustment for sociodemographic and health characteristics, comparison of the 
top and bottom quintiles showed that higher Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores (β 
= 0.065, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.018, 0.112; P-trend = 0.007), Alternate 
Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores (β = 0.054, 95% CI: 0.010, 0.097; P-trend = 
0.007), Mediterranean Diet scores (β = 0.058, 95% CI: 0.017, 0.098; P-trend = 
0.008), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores (β = 0.052, 
95% CI: 0.014, 0.090; P-trend = 0.007) were each associated with longer telomere 
length in women. These results may provide insight into the complex associations 
between optimal nutrition and longevity. Further investigation is needed to 
understand why associations were not observed in men.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between statin drug use and peripheral 
blood leukocyte telomere length in a U.S. nationally representative sample of 
adults.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002, representative of the 
noninstitutionalized U.S.
POPULATION: The analytic study population included 3496 men and women aged 
40-84 years without a history of cancer and who had information of telomere 
length and statin use.
RESULTS: Compared with nonusers, statin users were more likely to be former 
smokers, older, white, male, and had more comorbidities. Statin users did not 
have longer telomeres than nonusers after age (coefficient -0.013, p = .30) and 
multivariable (0.0003, p = .98) adjustment. After multivariable adjustment, 
log-transformed telomere length nonstatistically significantly increased with 
increasing duration of use (0.003, p-trend = .11), which did not differ by 
number of comorbidities (p-interaction = 0.18). Compared with nonuse, more than 
5 years of use had an odds ratio of telomere length above the 75th percentile of 
1.62 (95% confidence interval 0.90-2.92; p-trend = .10).
CONCLUSIONS: Although telomere length appeared to be longer with longer duration 
of use of a statin, this association was not statistically significant, and we 
could not rule out bias as the explanation.

BACKGROUND & AIM: Telomere length and telomerase have been linked with cirrhosis 
and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the impact of telomere length on 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and advanced fibrosis in a large national 
population sample is not well understood.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey 1999-2002 were utilized. Suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was 
diagnosed if serum alanine aminotransferase was >30 IU/L for men and >19 IU/L 
for women in the absence of other causes of chronic liver disease. Presence of 
advanced fibrosis was determined by the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
fibrosis score, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index and FIB-4 
score.
RESULTS: Of the 6738 participants (mean age 46.3 years, 48.4% male), suspected 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease prevalence was inversely associated with 
leucocyte telomere length in young adults aged 20-39 years, though this was not 
seen in the overall population. Percentage of participants with advanced 
fibrosis increased corresponding with leucocyte telomere length (longest to 
shortest). The shortest quartile of leucocyte telomere length was associated 
with a significantly higher odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of advanced 
fibrosis of 2.36 (1.32-4.24) in a univariate model compared to the longest 
quartile, and 2.01 (1.13-3.58) in a multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, 
ethnicity, waist circumference, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, total 
cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P for trend <.05 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large nationally representative sample of American adults, 
leucocyte telomere shortening was associated with increased risk of advanced 
fibrosis in the setting of suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
independent of other known risk factors.

Preliminary evidence suggests that sex steroid hormones, such as danazol (a 
synthetic sex steroid hormone), may be involved in enhancing telomerase 
activity. Elucidating underlying mechanisms of telomerase activity may further 
therapeutic options for individuals with telomeropathies and potentially avert 
certain age-related conditions. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study 
to investigate the relationship between circulating sex steroid hormones and 
SHBG with leukocyte telomere length among 499 males in NHANES (1999-2002 
surveys). Sample-weighted linear regression analyses were conducted to assess 
age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted estimates of associations. Estimates 
were rescaled to represent telomere length change in base pairs per half the 
value of the interquartile range of the independent variable. Estradiol and free 
estradiol were significantly inversely associated with leukocyte telomere length 
(βcontinuous per §IQR  = -61, p = 0.04; free estradiol βcontinuous per §IQR  
= -67, p = 0.03). Testosterone, free testosterone, androstanediol glucuronide, 
and SHBG were not associated with leukocyte telomere length. The inverse 
association seen in this study indicates that a danazol-induced hypoestrogenic 
state could partly underlie the previously observed association between danazol 
therapy and increased leukocyte telomere length.

The relationship between fiber intake and telomere length was evaluated using a 
cross-sectional design and an NHANES sample of 5674 U.S. adults. Another purpose 
was to test the impact of potential confounders on the association. Fiber 
consumption was measured using a 24 h recall and telomere length was indexed 
using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Overall, the U.S. 
adults had low fiber intake (median: 6.6 g per 1000 kcal)-less than one-half the 
recommendation of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. With age, gender, race, 
housing status, and misreported energy intake controlled, the relationship 
between fiber intake per 1000 kcal and telomere length was linear (F = 9.5, p = 
0.0045). Specifically, for each 1 g increment in fiber intake per 1000 kcal, 
telomeres were 8.3 base pairs longer. Because each additional year of 
chronological age was associated with telomeres that were 15.5 base pairs 
shorter, results suggest that a 10 g increase in fiber intake per 1000 kcal 
would correspond with telomeres that are 83 base pairs longer. On average, this 
would equate to 5.4 fewer years of biologic aging (83 ÷ 15.5). With smoking, 
BMI, alcohol use, and physical activity controlled, as well as the other 
covariates, each 10 g increment in fiber accounted for telomeres that were 67 
base pairs longer (F = 7.6, p = 0.0101), a biologic aging difference of about 
4.3 years. In conclusion, significant fiber consumption accounts for longer 
telomeres and less biologic aging than lower levels of fiber intake.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between plasma trans-fatty 
acids (TFAs) levels and leucocyte telomere length (TL) in a US adult population 
sample.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
database was used for this study. Gas chromatography was used to separate 
derivatised fatty acids (Four major TFAs [palmitelaidic acid (C16:1n-7t), trans 
vaccenic acid (C18:1n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1n-9t), and linoelaidic acid 
(C18:2n-6t,9t)]) which were then quatified using negative chemical ionization 
mass spectrometry. Data analyses used multivariable linear regressions, while 
accounting for the survey design.
RESULTS: A total of 5446 eligible participants, with 46.8% (n = 2550) being men, 
were included. Their average age was 47.1 years for the total sample, and 47.8 
and 46.5 years in men and women respectively (p = 0.085 for men vs. women 
difference). Concentrations of palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid 
decreased with increasing length of the telomere (p < 0.05). Univariable linear 
regressions revealed a significant negative association between levels of the 
palmitelaidic acid, elaidic acid, vaccenic acid, and linolelaidic acid with TL. 
However when models were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital 
status, sub-clinical inflammation, body mass index, and smoking, only 
palmitelaidic acid and linolelaidic acid remained significant (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: TFAs levels and particularly palmitelaidic and linolelaidic acids, 
are likely negatively associated with telomere lenght. Future studies should 
explore the potential implications of these associations.

STUDY QUESTION: Is telomere length related to parity among a nationally 
representative sample of US reproductive age women?
SUMMARY ANSWER: History of live birth was associated with shorter telomere 
length.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Shorter telomeres have been linked with a range of 
chronic health conditions and mortality and parity has been associated with 
health indicators. However, there is a lack of research on how parity relates to 
telomere length.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This nationally representative, cross-sectional 
study included 1954 women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey, 1999-2002, the only survey period which includes measurement of telomere 
length.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women aged 20-44 were included. 
Parity, defined as number of previous live births, was ascertained by 
questionnaire. Leukocyte telomere length was measured by polymerase chain 
reaction and reported as a ratio in relation to standard reference DNA (T/S 
ratio). The relationship between leukocyte T/S ratio and parity was examined 
using survey weighted linear regression. Models were adjusted for 
race/ethnicity, age, BMI, income-to-poverty ratio, education, early age at 
menarche and smoking status.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among reproductive age women in the US, the 
adjusted mean leukocyte T/S ratio was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.9, 7.3) shorter in parous 
compared with nulliparous women. Parity was associated with 116 fewer base pairs 
(95% CI: 26, 204) on average, using estimated coefficients from the adjusted 
linear regression models and mean covariate values.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was cross-sectional and therefore 
was unable to establish temporality. The dataset lacked information on social 
factors, stress and fertility status, which may help explain these findings. 
Only two previous studies have examined this question and our findings should be 
interpreted with caution.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings in a nationally 
representative sample of US reproductive age women suggest that history of live 
birth may be associated with accelerated cellular aging. The magnitude of the 
observed association was greater than that of the impact of smoking or obesity 
on telomere length, suggesting that parity may have an independent influence on 
cellular aging and warrant further study.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was funded in part by the 
Undergraduate Research Scholars Program at George Mason University. The authors 
have no conflicts of interest.

In Lebanon, data stemming from national cross-sectional surveys indicated 
significant increasing trends in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and 
associated behavioral and age-related risk factors. To our knowledge, no data 
are available on relative telomere length (RTL) as a potential biomarker for 
age-related diseases in a Lebanese population. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate whether there is an association between RTL and demographic 
characteristics, lifestyle habits and diseases in the Lebanese. This was a 
cross-sectional study of 497 Lebanese subjects. Peripheral blood RTL was 
measured by amplifying telomere and single copy gene using real-time PCR. Mean ± 
SD RTL was 1.42 ± 0.83, and it was categorized into 3 tertiles. Older age 
(P=0.002) and wider waist circumference (WC) (P=0.001) were statistically 
significantly associated with shorter RTL. Multinomial logistic regression 
showed that subjects who had some level of sleeping difficulty had a 
statistically significantly shorter RTL when compared to those with no sleeping 
difficulties at all [OR (95% CI): 2.01 (1.11-3.62) in the first RTL tertile]. 
Importantly, statistically significantly shorter RTL was found with every 
additional 10 cm of WC [OR (95% CI): 1.30 (1.11-1.52) for first RTL tertile]. In 
addition, and after performing the multivariate logistic regression and 
adjusting for "predictors" of RTL, the odds of having hypertension or being 
treated for hypertension were higher in patients who had shorter RTL: OR (95% 
CI): 2.45 (1.36-4.44) and 2.28 (1.22-4.26) in the first RTL tertiles 
respectively with a similar trend, though not statistically significant, in the 
second RTL tertiles. This is the first study in Lebanon to show an association 
between age, central obesity, poor sleep and hypertension and RTL. It is hoped 
that telomere length measurement be potentially used as a biomarker for 
biological age and age-related diseases and progression in the Lebanese.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of muscle mass or 
function with aging and is associated with adverse outcomes. Telomere shortening 
is associated with mortality, yet its relationship with sarcopenia is unknown.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Adults ≥60 years from the 1999-2002 NHANES with body 
composition measures were identified. Sarcopenia was defined using the two 
Foundation for the National Institute of Health definitions: appendicular lean 
mass (ALM) (men <19.75; women <15.02 kg); or ALM divided by body mass index 
(BMI) (ALM:BMI, men <0.789; women <0.512). Telomere length was assessed using 
quantitative PCR. Regression models predicted telomere length with sarcopenia 
(referent = no sarcopenia).
RESULTS: We identified 2672 subjects. Mean age was 70.9 years (55.5% female). 
Prevalence of ALM and ALM:BMI sarcopenia was 29.2 and 22.1%. Deaths were higher 
in persons with sarcopenia as compared to those without sarcopenia (ALM: 46.4 
vs. 33.4%, p < 0.001; ALM:BMI: 46.7 vs. 33.2%, p < 0.001). No adjusted 
differences were observed in telomere length in those with/without sarcopenia 
(ALM: 0.90 vs. 0.92, p = 0.74, ALM:BMI 0.89 vs. 0.92, p = 0.24). In men with 
ALM:BMI-defined sarcopenia, adjusted telomere length was significantly lower 
compared to men without sarcopenia (0.85 vs. 0.91, p = 0.013). With sarcopenia, 
we did not observe a significant association between telomere length and 
mortality (ALM: HR 1.11 [0.64,1.82], p = 0.68; ALM:BMI: HR 0.97 [0.53,1.77], 
p = 0.91), but noted significance in those without sarcopenia with mortality 
(ALM: HR 0.59 [0.40,0.86], p = 0.007; ALM:BMI: HR 0.62 [0.42,0.91]; p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a potentially inverse relationship between telomere 
length and mortality in those without sarcopenia but did not observe a 
significant relationship between telomere length and mortality in the presence 
of sarcopenia.

Telomeres contain TTAGGG repetitive sequences and are located at the end of 
human chromosomes. Telomere dysfunction is associated with some age-related and 
chronic diseases, but its relationship with foods, dietary patterns, and 
occupational class in the young male population is not yet known. In this 
cross-sectional study, 300 healthy men, residents of Tehran, aged 25-40 years 
were enrolled from January to December 2016. We employed a cross-sectional study 
of 300 healthy people, residents of Tehran, aged 25-40 years. A food frequency 
questionnaire was used to obtain food intakes of all participants and converted 
into actual food intake (g/day). The principal components analysis was used to 
determine dietary patterns and other demographic characteristics. Leukocyte 
telomere length (TL) was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) to measure number of telomere repeat copy number (T) to the 
relative number of 36B4 copies (S) (T/S ratio). T/S in office-workers, waste 
recyclers, and other workers were 1.22 ± 0.4, 1.08 ± 0.3, and 1.094 ± 0.34, 
respectively. The results of multivariate linear regression adjusted for age, 
body mass index (BMI), and smoking were showed that whole grains (β = 0.02; p = 
.05), refined grains, fruits and vegetables, fish and dairy products were 
associated with an increase in log-T/S, but consumption of nuts and seeds (β = 
-0.00072; p = .06), meats (β = -0.00043; p = .9), produced meats (β = -0.00238; 
p = .03), oils and solid fats (β = -0.00146; p = .03) had a negative 
relationship with log-T/S in all studied occupational classes. A positive 
relationship was reported between the healthy (β = 0.017; p = .2) and 
traditional dietary pattern (β = 0.012; p = .4) with log-T/S, but western 
pattern identified negative relationship (β = -0.004; p = .7). Adherence to a 
healthy (with consumption whole grains, refined grains, dairy, and cereals) and 
then traditional pattern with increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and 
whole grains, fish and dairy products are necessary to prevent TL destruction in 
all studied occupational classes.

BACKGROUND: Telomere length is an emerging novel biomarker of biologic age, 
cardiovascular risk and chronic medical conditions. Few studies have focused on 
the association between telomere length (TL) and kidney function.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between TL and kidney 
function/prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD) in US adults.
METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
participants with measured data on kidney function and TL from 1999 to 2002 were 
included. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was based on CKD 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Urinary albumin excretion was 
assessed using urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). We used multivariable 
adjusted linear and logistic regression models, accounting for the survey design 
and sample weights.
RESULTS: Of the 10568 eligible participants, 48.0% (n=5020) were men. Their mean 
age was 44.1 years. eGFR significantly decreased and ACR significantly increased 
across increasing quarters of TL (all p<0.001). The association between TL and 
kidney function remained robust even after adjusting for potential confounding 
factors, but the association between TL and ACR was only borderline significant 
(β-coefficient= -0.012, p=0.056).
CONCLUSION: The association of kidney function with a marker of cellular 
senescence suggests an underlying mechanism influencing the progression of 
nephropathy.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker of 
biologic age. Whether food security status modulates LTL is still unknown. We 
investigated the association between food security and LTL in participants of 
the 1999-2002 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
METHODS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate the association 
between food security categories and LTL controlling for sex, race, and 
education and accounting for the survey design and sample weights.
RESULTS: We included 10,888 participants with 5228 (48.0%) being men. They were 
aged on average 44.1 years. In all, 2362 (21.7%) had less than high school, 2787 
(25.6%) had achieved high school, while 5705 (52.5%) had done more than high 
school. In sex-, race-, and education-adjusted ANCOVA, average LTL (T/S ratio) 
for participants with high food security versus those with marginal, low, or 
very low food security was 1.32 versus 1.20 for the age group 25-35 years and 
1.26 versus 1.11 for the 35-45 years, (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The association between food insecurity and LTL shortening in young 
adults suggest that some of the future effects of food insecurity on chronic 
disease risk in this population could be mediated by telomere shortening.

Chronic pain is a common condition associated with psychological distress, 
functional impairments, and age-associated comorbidity. Preliminary studies, on 
the basis of relatively small sample sizes, suggest that the combination of 
chronic pain and stress is associated with telomere shortening, a widely 
recognized marker of cellular aging. We sought to determine the cross-sectional 
association of chronic pain with telomere length in 7,816 community-dwelling 
adults ages 20 years and older who participated in the 1999 to 2002 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Consistent with previous studies, 
leukocyte telomere length was assessed using the quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction method and compared with a DNA reference standard to compute a telomere 
to single copy gene ratio. Standardized, in-person interviews were used to 
identify chronic regional pain and chronic widespread pain in 784 (10.0%) and 
266 (3.4%) participants, respectively. Older age, male sex, obesity, and less 
physical activity were associated with shorter telomere length (P <.05 for all 
comparisons); however, there was no association of chronic pain with telomere 
length. The age-adjusted means (standard error) of telomere length telomere to 
single copy gene ratios were 1.04 (.02), 1.03 (.02), and 1.02 (.02) in 
participants with no chronic pain, chronic regional pain, and chronic widespread 
pain, respectively (P = .69). In addition, chronic pain did not modify the 
effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, or psychological distress on 
telomere length. In summary, chronic regional and widespread pain were not 
associated with telomere length in this nationally representative study; 
however, we could not determine associations of pain duration and severity with 
telomere length because of limitations in pain assessment data.
PERSPECTIVE: The findings from the current study do not support the hypothesis 
that chronic pain accelerates cellular aging measured according to leukocyte 
telomere length. Additional population-based studies with more detailed 
assessments of pain and stress are needed to further investigate potential 
interactive effects on telomere length and other biomarkers of aging.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Telomere shortening is associated with age and risk of 
medical comorbidity. We assessed the relationship between measures of adiposity, 
leukocyte telomere length, and mortality and whether it is modified by age.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Subjects with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measures were 
identified using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. 
Obesity was categorized using two body fat definitions (BF1%: men ⩾25%; females 
⩾35%; BF2% ⩾28% and ⩾38%, respectively), body mass index (BMI) and waist 
circumference (WC; men ⩾102 cm; females ⩾88 cm). Telomere length relative to 
standard reference DNA (T/S ratio) was assessed using quantitative PCR. Weighted 
multivariable regression models evaluated the association of telomere length 
with adiposity, both continuously and categorically (low/normal BF%, low/high WC 
and standard BMI categories). Differences in telomere length by age and 
adiposity were ascertained and subsequent models were stratified by age. 
Proportional hazard models assessed the risk of mortality by adiposity status. A 
telomere by adiposity interaction was tested in the entire cohort and by age 
category (<60 vs ⩾60 years; <70 vs ⩾70 years).
RESULTS: We identified 7827 subjects. Mean age was 46.1 years. Overall telomere 
length was 1.05±0.01 (s.e.) that differed by BF1% (low/high: 1.12±0.02 vs 
1.03±0.02; P<0.001), BF2% (1.02±0.02 vs 1.11±0.02; P<0.001), BMI (underweight 
1.08±0.03; normal 1.09±0.02; overweight 1.04±0.02; and obese 1.03±0.02;P<0.001) 
and WC (low/high 1.09±0.02 vs 1.02±0.02; P<0.001). Adjusted β-coefficients 
evaluating the relationship between telomere length and adiposity (measured 
continuously) were as follows: BF1% (β=-0.0033±0.0008; P<0.001), BF2% 
(-0.041±0.008; P<0.001), BMI (β=-0.025±0.0008; P=0.005) and WC 
(β=-0.0011±0.0004; P=0.007). High BF% (BF1%: β=-0.035±0.011; P=0.002; BF2%: 
β=-0.041±0.008; P<0.001) and WC (β=-0.035±0.011; P=0.008) were inversely related 
to telomere length (TL). Stratifying by age, high BF1% (-0.061±0.013), BF2% 
(-0.065±0.01), BMI-obesity (-0.07±0.015) and high WC (-0.048±0.013) were 
significant (all P<0.001). This association diminished with increasing age. In 
older participants, TL was inversely related to mortality (hazard ratio 0.36 
(0.27, 0.49)), as were those classified by BF1% (0.68 (0.56, 0.81)), BF2% (0.75 
(0.65, 0.80)), BMI (0.50 (0.42, 0.60)) and WC (0.72 (0.63, 0.83)). No 
interaction was observed between adiposity status, telomere length and 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with shorter telomere length in young 
participants, a relationship that diminishes with increasing age. It does not 
moderate the relationship with mortality.

Leukocyte telomere length is shorter in response to chronic disease processes 
associated with inflammation such as diabetes mellitus and coronary artery 
disease. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
from 1999 to 2002 was used to explore the relationship between leukocyte 
telomere length and presumed NAFLD, as indicated by elevated serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) levels, obesity, or abdominal obesity. Logistic 
regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between telomere length 
and presumed markers of NAFLD adjusting for possible confounders. There was no 
relationship between elevated ALT levels, abdominal obesity, or obesity and 
telomere length in adjusted models in NHANES (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.48-2.65; OR 
1.17, 95% CI 0.52-2.62, resp.). Mexican-American men had shorter telomere length 
in relation to presumed NAFLD (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.006-0.79) and using different 
indicators of NAFLD (OR 0.012, 95% CI 0.0006-0.24). Mexican origin with presumed 
NAFLD had shorter telomere length than men in other population groups. 
Longitudinal studies are necessary to evaluate the role of telomere length as a 
potential predictor to assess pathogenesis of NALFD in Mexicans.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the independent associations of sedentary behavior and 
physical activity with telomere length among Chinese adults.
METHODS: Data on total time of sedentary behavior, screen-based sedentary 
behavior (including television watching and computer or phone use), moderate to 
vigorous physical activity, and dietary intake of 518 adults in Chengdu, 
Guizhou, and Xiamen in China (54.25% women) aged 20 to 70 years were obtained 
between 2013 and 2015 through questionnaires. Height, weight, and waist 
circumference were measured to calculate body mass index and percentage of body 
fat. Telomere length was measured through Southern blot technique.
RESULTS: Television watching was inversely related to adjusted telomere length 
(-71.75 base pair; SE = 34.40; P  = .04). Furthermore, a similar trend between 
telomere length and television watching was found in the group aged 20 to 40 
years after adjusting for all covariates. Adults aged 20 to 40 years in the 
highest tertile of daily time spent on watching television had 4.0% shorter 
telomere length than adults in the lowest tertile (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the association is modest, television watching is 
inversely related to telomere length among Chinese adults, warranting further 
investigation in large prospective studies.

Antioxidants have a number of potential health benefits. The present 
investigation was designed to determine the relationship between serum alpha- 
and gamma-tocopherol levels (powerful antioxidants), and leukocyte telomere 
length (a biomarker of biological aging). A cross-sectional design was employed 
to study 5768 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES). DNA was obtained via blood samples. Telomere length was assessed using 
the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Serum concentrations of 
alpha- and gamma-tocopherol were measured using high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that for each one-year increase in age, 
telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter (F = 410.4, p < 0.0001). After adjusting 
for differences in the demographic covariates, for each µg/dL higher level of 
gamma-tocopherol, telomeres were 0.33 base pairs shorter (F = 7.1, p = 0.0126). 
Telomeres were approximately 1 year shorter (15.6 base pairs) for each increment 
of 47.3 to 55.7 µg/dL of gamma-tocopherol in the blood, depending on the 
variables controlled. Adults at the 75th percentile of gamma-tocopherol had 
2.8-3.4 years greater cellular aging than those at the 25th percentile, 
depending on the covariates in the model. However, alpha-tocopherol was not 
related to telomere length. Evidently, gamma-tocopherol levels, but not 
alpha-tocopherol, account for meaningful increases in biological aging.

BACKGROUND: The investigation evaluated the relationship between caffeine intake 
and coffee consumption and leukocyte telomere length, a biomarker of the 
senescence of cells.
METHODS: A total of 5826 adults from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) were studied cross-sectionally. Using the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction method, telomere length was compared to 
standard reference DNA. Caffeine intake from foods and beverages and coffee 
consumption were measured using a validated, multi-pass, computer-assisted, 24-h 
recall system administered by NHANES interviewers. The following covariates were 
controlled: age, gender, race, marital status, education, housing, smoking, BMI, 
physical activity, alcohol use, and coffee intake (or caffeine consumption).
RESULTS: Caffeine consumption was inversely related to telomere length (F = 
15.1, P = 0.0005). For each 100 mg of caffeine consumed, telomeres were 35.4 
base pairs shorter, after adjusting for the covariates. For each 100 mg of 
caffeine consumed among coffee drinkers only, telomeres were 36.7 base pairs 
shorter (F = 9.0, P = 0.0054), and among non-coffee drinkers only, 40.0 base 
pairs shorter (F = 8.5, P = 0.0067). Conversely, coffee intake was positively 
related to telomere length (F = 12.6, P = 0.0013), independent of the 
covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that caffeine consumption accounts for shorter 
telomeres in U.S. adults, independent of numerous covariates, whereas coffee 
intake predicts longer telomeres.

Telomere length (TL) has been associated with age-related health outcomes. We 
investigated the relationship of TL with cardiometabolic risk profile in adult 
Americans. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for 
1999 to 2002, accounting for complex sampling and survey design. Of the 8892 
eligible participants, 47.8% (n = 4123) were men. Mean serum high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations significantly increased across increasing 
TL quarters ( P = .013), and mean fat mass, fat-free mass, hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c), and C-reactive protein significantly decreased across increasing TL 
quarters (all P < .001) in men. Only HbA1c levels significantly decreased across 
increasing TL quarters ( P = .041) in women. Males in the upper quarter of TL 
had lower (38%) odds of prevalent metabolic syndrome compared with those in the 
lower quarter ( P < .001). These results support the hypotheses that 
cardiometabolic factors are related to TL, especially in men.

INTRODUCTION: Telomere length (TL) is related to age-related health outcomes, 
but little is known about the relationship between TL and complete blood count 
(CBC) parameters. We aimed to determine the relationship between TL and CBC in a 
sample of healthy US adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants in the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) recruited between 1999 and 2002 who had essential 
data on total CBC and TL were studied. We computed age- and race-adjusted mean 
values for total CBC using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). All statistical 
analyses accounted for the survey design and sample weights by using SPSS 
Complex Samples v22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS: Of the 8892 eligible participants, 47.8% (n = 4123) were men. The mean 
age was 41.8 years overall, 41.0 years in men and 42.6 in women (p = 0.238). The 
sex-stratified ANCOVA showed no significant difference in the total CBC across 
TL quartiles (all p > 0.05) in both sexes. In the adjusted model, there was a 
significant negative relationship with monocyte count (β = -0.051, 95% CI: 
-0.422; -0.142), mean cell hemoglobin (β = -0.051, 95% CI: -0.038; -0.011) and 
red cell distribution width (β = -0.031, 95% CI: -0.054; -0.003), while there 
was a significant positive relationship with basophil ratio (β = 0.046, 95% CI: 
0.049-0.171).
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the possibility that telomere attrition may 
be a marker for reduced proliferative reserve in hematopoietic progenitor cells.

The principal objective was to determine the extent to which physical activity 
(PA) accounts for differences in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in a large 
random sample of U.S. adults. Another purpose was to assess the extent to which 
multiple demographic and lifestyle covariates affect the relationship between PA 
and LTL. A total of 5823 adults from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2002) were studied cross-sectionally. Employing 
the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method, LTL was compared to standard 
reference DNA. PA was indexed using MET-minutes using self-reported frequency, 
intensity, and duration of participation in 62 physical activities. Covariates 
were controlled statistically. Telomeres were 15.6 base pairs shorter for each 
year of chronological age (F=723.2, P<0.0001). PA was inversely related to LTL 
after adjusting for all the covariates (F=8.3, P=0.0004). Telomere base pair 
differences between adults with High activity and those in the Sedentary, Low, 
and Moderate groups were 140, 137, and 111, respectively. Adults with High 
activity were estimated to have a biologic aging advantage of 9years (140 base 
pairs÷15.6) over Sedentary adults. The difference in cell aging between those 
with High and Low activity was also significant, 8.8years, as was the difference 
between those with High and Moderate PA (7.1years). Overall, PA was 
significantly and meaningfully associated with telomere length in U.S. men and 
women. Evidently, adults who participate in high levels of PA tend to have 
longer telomeres, accounting for years of reduced cellular aging compared to 
their more sedentary counterparts.

A shorter telomere length is associated with several systemic disorders. 
Telomere length may be an informative biomarker for the maintenance of the 
overall health status and mortality. There are a limited number of empirical 
studies concerning the effect of anthropometric parameters on telomere length. 
The data are derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
from 1999 to 2002. The primary outcomes of this study were to examine the 
potential relationships between the anthropometric indices and the telomere 
length, while secondary outcomes of this study was to investigate the 
association between different anthropometric indices and mortality risk. A 
significant positive correlation was noted between the mean telomere length and 
the thigh circumference (TC) and calf circumference (CC) in all designed models. 
Participants in the highest TC and CC quartiles tended to have a longer telomere 
length and lowered the hazards for all-cause mortality to 43% and 57%, 
respectively. Notably, the anthropometric indices involving the CC with higher 
values seemed to be surrogate markers for the reduction of the risk of 
all-cause, cardiovascular and malignancy-related mortality (all P < 0.05). The 
CCmay be a valuable tool to guide public health policy and a clinical prognostic 
indicator for the risk of mortality.

Background: Multilevel frameworks suggest neighborhood circumstances influence 
biology; however, this relationship is not well studied. Telomere length (TL) 
shortening has been associated with individual-level and neighborhood-level 
exposures and disease and may provide insights into underlying biologic 
mechanisms linking neighborhood with biology. To support neighborhood-biology 
investigations, we sought to determine the independent effect of neighborhood 
exposures on TL using standard multilevel linear regression models and quantile 
regression, a nonlinear, social science method applicable for testing the 
biologic hypothesis that extremes of the TL distribution are related to poor 
outcomes.Methods: In a multicenter, cross-sectional study, blood TL was measured 
in 1,488 individuals from 127 census tracts in three U.S. regions using terminal 
restriction fragment assays. Multilevel linear and quantile regression models 
were adjusted for individual-level race, education, perceived stress, and 
depression. Neighborhood exposures included population density, 
urban/residential crowding, residential stability/mobility, and socioeconomic 
status.Results: TL was not associated with any neighborhood variable using 
linear models, but quantile regression revealed inverse associations between 
population density and urban crowding at the lower tails of the TL distribution 
[5th (population density P = 0.03; urban crowding P = 0.002), 50th (both P < 
0.001), 75th percentiles (both P < 0.001)]. TL was related to residential 
stability at the upper tail (95th percentile P = 0.006).Conclusions: Findings 
support the use of nonlinear statistical methods in TL research and suggest that 
neighborhood exposures can result in biological effects.Impact: TL may serve as 
an underlying example of a biologic mechanism that can link neighborhood with 
biology, thus supporting multilevel investigations in future studies. Cancer

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between leukocyte 
telomere length (LTL) and mortality (outcome variable), with consideration by 
physical activity behaviour. Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey were employed (N = 6,611; 20-85 yrs), with 
follow-up mortality assessment through 31 December 2006. DNA was extracted from 
whole blood to assess LTL via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared 
to those in the first LTL tertile, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause 
mortality for those in the 2nd and 3rd LTL tertiles, respectively, was 0.82 (95% 
CI: 0.60-1.12; P = .22) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.50-1.14; P = .18). However, after 
adjustments, LTL tertile 3 (vs. 1) was associated with all-cause mortality 
(HR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.14-0.93; P = .03) for those who engaged in 
moderate-intensity exercise. Similarly, LTL was associated with CVD-specific 
mortality for those who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise (HR = 0.17; 95% 
CI: 0.04-0.73; P = .02). Longer telomeres are associated with increased 
survival, particularly among men and those who are active, underscoring the 
importance of promotion of physical activity behaviour.

Background: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker of the aging process 
and is associated with the risk of chronic disease. Higher exposure to cadmium 
may be associated with shorter LTL, and adequate nutrient concentrations may be 
associated with longer LTL; however, the potential interaction between metals 
and nutrients on LTL has yet to be examined.Objectives: The objective of this 
study was to evaluate whether serum concentrations of vitamins and carotenoids 
were associated with LTL, and whether they modified the association between 
blood cadmium and LTL in the US NHANES (1999-2002).Methods: We evaluated 
cross-sectional associations between LTL and serum concentrations of vitamin A, 
γ-tocopherol, α-tocopherol, folate, and vitamin B-12 (1999-2002; n = 7458) and 
α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein + zeaxanthin, and lycopene 
(2001-2002; n = 4018) in a nationally representative sample of US adults (≥20 y 
of age) with the use of multivariable linear regression. We further investigated 
whether vitamin and carotenoid concentrations modified associations between 
blood cadmium and LTL with models stratified by serum nutrient concentrations 
and the inclusion of an interaction term.Results: Blood cadmium was inversely 
associated with LTL (percentage of LTL difference per 1 μg/L = -3.74; 95% CI: 
-5.35, -2.10). Serum vitamin A was positively associated (percentage of LTL 
difference per 1 μg/L = 4.01; 95% CI: 0.26, 7.90) and γ-tocopherol was inversely 
associated (percentage of LTL difference per 1 μg/dL = -2.49; 95% CI: -4.21, 
-0.73) with LTL. Serum folate (P-trend = 0.06) and α-tocopherol (P-trend = 0.10) 
were marginally positively associated with LTL, whereas vitamin B-12 (P-trend = 
0.78) was not associated with LTL. Serum carotenoids were generally positively 
associated with LTL. Serum vitamin and carotenoid concentrations did not modify 
blood cadmium and LTL associations (P-interaction > 0.10).Conclusions: Results 
from this cross-sectional study suggest that exposure to cadmium and certain 
nutrients may be associated with LTL in US adults, but the serum concentrations 
of the vitamins and carotenoids evaluated did not modify cross-sectional 
associations between cadmium exposure and LTL.

OBJECTIVES: Consumption of nuts and seeds is associated favorably with all-cause 
mortality. Nuts and seeds could reduce disease and prolong life by influencing 
telomeres. Telomere length is a good indicator of the senescence of cells. The 
purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between nuts and 
seeds intake and leukocyte telomere length, a biomarker of biologic aging.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,582 randomly selected men and women from 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999-2002, were 
studied.
MEASUREMENTS: DNA was obtained via blood samples. Telomere length was assessed 
using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. A validated, 
multi-pass, 24-h recall dietary assessment, administered by NHANES, was employed 
to quantify consumption of nuts and seeds.
RESULTS: Nuts and seeds intake was positively and linearly associated with 
telomere length. For each 1-percent of total energy derived from nuts and seeds, 
telomere length was 5 base pairs longer (F=8.6, P=0.0065). Given the age-related 
rate of telomere shortening was 15.4 base pairs per year (F=581.1, P<0.0001), 
adults of the same age had more than 1.5 years of reduced cell aging if they 
consumed 5% of their total energy from nuts and seeds.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of nuts and seeds accounts for meaningful decreases in 
biologic aging and cell senescence. The findings reinforce the recommendations 
of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourage the 
consumption of nuts and seeds as part of a healthy diet.

Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to all-cause mortality and 
cancer. However, the biological plausibility of these associations is not well 
established. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortening is associated with aging 
and is a hallmark of genomic instability and carcinogenesis.Objective: We aimed 
to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] 
concentrations and LTL in the general US population.Methods: We analyzed data 
from the US NHANES 2001-2002. The study population comprised 1542 younger adults 
(aged 20-39 y), 1336 middle-aged adults (aged 40-59 y), and 1382 older adults 
(aged ≥60 y). LTL was measured by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations ≥50 nmol/L were considered optimal. Linear 
regression, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), total 
energy and sugar intakes, calcium intake, socioeconomic status, milk and dietary 
supplement consumption, and physical activity, was applied to investigate the 
association between serum 25(OH)D and LTL.Results: In the total population, age, 
sex, BMI, and non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity were significant predictors of 
LTL. In the participants aged 40-59 y, an increment in serum 25(OH)D of 10 
nmol/L was associated with a 0.03- ± 0.01-kbp longer LTL, adjusted for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, and other factors (P = 0.001). In the same age group, 25(OH)D 
concentrations ≥50 nmol/L were associated with a 0.13- ± 0.04-kbp longer LTL 
than those for 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nmol/L (P = 0.01). The association was 
independent of age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, and other factors.Conclusions: In 
a nationally representative population of adults, serum 25(OH)D was positively 
associated with LTL in middle-aged participants (aged 40-59 y), independently of 
other factors. These findings suggest that decreased 25(OH)D concentrations are 
associated with genomic instability, although the clinical impact of this 
observation remains unclear.

BACKGROUND: The associations between individual cardiovascular disease risk 
factors and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) have been inconclusive. We 
investigated the association between LTL and overall cardiovascular health (CVH) 
as defined by the American Heart Association and whether the association is 
modified by sex and race/ethnicity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 5194 adults (aged ≥20) from the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. CVH was defined as a composite score 
of the 7 metrics (smoking, physical activity, diet, body mass index, blood 
pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose) and categorized as 
"poor," "intermediate," and "ideal." LTL was assayed from whole blood using the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction method relative to standard reference 
DNA. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the 
association between CVH and log-transformed LTL. We found strong graded 
association between CVH and LTL in the overall sample, with evidence of 
dose-response relationship (P for trend=0.013). Individuals with poor and 
intermediate CVH had significantly shorter LTL than individuals with ideal CVH 
(-3.4% [95% CI=-6.0%, -0.8%] and -2.4% [-4.4%, -0.3%], respectively), after 
adjustment for demographic variables, socioeconomic status, and C-reactive 
protein. The association was stronger in women (-6.6% [-10.2%, -2.9%] for poor 
vs ideal CVH) and non-Hispanic whites (-4.3% [-7.1%, -1.4%] for poor vs ideal 
CVH).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that less-than-ideal CVH is associated with 
shorter LTL, but this association varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Future 
longitudinal research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the 
association between CVH and LTL.

Mineral and vitamin consumption and telomere length among adults in the United 
States.

Mazidi M, Kengne AP, Banach M.

INTRODUCTION    Shorter leukocyte telomere length (TL) is associated with 
several chronic diseases, but only a few studies have assessed the associations 
of dietary components and dietary patterns with TL in adults in the United 
States (US). OBJECTIVES    This study was aimed to determine the relation of 
dietary components and dietary patterns with TL among adults in the US. PATIENTS 
AND METHODS    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
participants with data on dietary intake and TL measures from 1999 to 2001 were 
included. Daily intakes of 60 nutrients and bioactive compounds were calculated 
for each participant. Factor analysis, followed by a varimax rotation, was 
applied to derive the major nutrient patterns. All statistical analyses 
accounted for the survey design and sample weights. RESULTS    Of the 10 568 
eligible participants, 48.0% (n = 5020) were men; the mean age was 44.1 years. 
Mean (adjusted for sex, age, and race) dietary intakes of carbohydrate, dietary 
fiber, total folate, vitamin B6, magnesium, iron, copper, polyunsaturated fatty 
acids 22:5, and vitamin C monotonically increased across TL quarters (P <0.05 
for all), while total fat and caffeine decreased across TL quarters (P <0.05 for 
all). Three food patterns together explaining 56.8% of the variance of the 
dietary nutrient consumption were identified. We found that the second food 
pattern, which was a representative of minerals and vitamins, monotonically 
increased across TL quarters and had a positive association with TL. 
CONCLUSIONS    Higher mineral and vitamin consumption is associated with longer 
telomeres among adults in the US.

INTRODUCTION: Higher vitamin D levels and longer telomere length (TL) have been 
associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. 
However, direct relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and 
TL are not well established. Vitamin D could influence TL through its 
anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to assess the relationship 
between vitamin D levels and TL in US adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants of the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) with data available on 25(OH)D and TL measures from 
2001 to 2002 were included. 25(OH)D levels were measured by the DiaSorin 
Radioimmunoassay. We used multivariable-adjusted linear regression models, 
accounting for the survey design and sample weights.
RESULTS: Of the 4347 eligible participants, 47.0% (n = 2045) were men. The mean 
age was 42.7 years overall, 49.2 years in men and 42.5 years in women (p = 
0.060). After adjustment for age, race, marital status, education, and 
C-reactive protein, each 1 ng/ml higher 25(OH)D level was associated with a 
0.045 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.032 to 0.059) longer telomere-to-single 
copy gene (T/S) ratio. This was driven by a significant association in women 
(0.054 (0.043 to 0.064)) and in men (0.036 (0.020 to 0.052)). However, after we 
further adjusted for smoking, body mass index, and physical activity, no 
significant relation was found in the overall sample (β coefficient -0.026, 95% 
CI: -3.16, 1.67), for men (-0.016 (-3.72, 2.64)), or for women (-0.052 (-6.85, 
2.26)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a possible positive association between 
25(OH)D levels and telomere length. The implications of this association deserve 
further investigation.

PURPOSE: Telomeres are nucleotide sequences, and their function is to maintain 
cell surveillance. Exaggeration of the attrition rate of leukocyte telomere 
length (LTL) may result in genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Celiac disease 
(CD), an autoimmune inflammation of small intestine, has increasing prevalence 
in the elderly and may lead to lymphomas and gastrointestinal malignancies. We 
used nationally-representative datasets from the U.S. National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate if CD autoimmunity in older 
adults (age≥50years) is associated with shorter LTL.
RESULTS: Our study included 3939 subjects, where 25 subjects (mean age 65years) 
were CD seropositive and 3914 (mean age 64years) were CD seronegative. CD 
seropositive subjects had shorter LTL than CD seronegative subjects (P<0.001). 
In the linear regression model, CD seropositivity was significantly associated 
with 0.25kb pairs decrease in LTL length (P<0.001), adjusted for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, serum ferritin and folate, and ratio of family income to 
poverty.
CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally-representative population of adults age≥50years, CD 
seropositivity is significantly associated with shorter LTL, independently of 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, serum ferritin and folate, and socioeconomic status. 
This supports the enhanced telomere attrition in of CD seropositive adults.

Background: Emerging work is starting to investigate the cumulative effects of 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary behavior and 
cardiorespiratory fitness on health. The objective of this study was to examine 
the cumulative and independent associations of MVPA, sedentary behavior and 
cardiorespiratory fitness on leukocyte telomere length (LTL). Methods: Data from 
the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were 
used (N = 1868 adults 20+ years); analyzed in 2016. Sedentary behavior and MVPA 
were subjectively assessed with cardiorespiratory fitness determined from a 
submaximal treadmill-based test; participants were classified as above or below 
the median values for each of these three parameters. A blood sample was 
obtained from each participant to assess LTL via quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction, with participants grouped into LTL tertiles. Results: Participants who 
engaged in higher MVPA, sat less and had higher cardiorespiratory fitness had an 
increased odds (ranging from 85% to 105%) of being in LTL tertile 3 (vs. 1). In 
an extended adjusted multinomial logistic regression model, only MVPA was 
positively associated with LTL (odds ration [OR] = 1.37; 95% CI: 0.99-1.90; P = 
0.05). Conclusion: All three behavior characteristics, but particularly MVPA, 
may be important in preserving LTLs.

BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a putative biological marker of 
immune system age, and there are demonstrated associations between LTL and 
cardiovascular disease. This may be due in part to the relationship of LTL with 
other biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease risk. However, the 
strength of associations between LTL and adiposity, metabolic, proinflammatory, 
and cardiovascular biomarkers has not been systematically evaluated in a United 
States nationally representative population.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined associations between LTL and 17 cardiovascular 
biomarkers, including lipoproteins, blood sugar, circulatory pressure, 
proinflammatory markers, kidney function, and adiposity measures, in adults ages 
20 to 84 from the cross-sectional US nationally representative 1999-2002 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (n = 7,252), 
statistically adjusting for immune cell type distributions. We also examine 
whether these associations differed systematically by age, race/ethnicity, 
gender, education, and income. We found that a one unit difference in the 
following biomarkers were associated with kilobase pair differences in LTL: BMI 
-0.00478 (95% CI -0.00749--0.00206), waist circumference -0.00211 (95% CI 
-0.00325--0.000969), percentage of body fat -0.00516 (95% CI -0.00761--0.0027), 
high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 0.00179 (95% CI 0.000571-0.00301), 
triglycerides -0.000285 (95% CI -0.000555--0.0000158), pulse rate -0.00194 (95% 
CI -0.00317--0.000705), C-reactive protein -0.0363 (95% CI 0.0601--0.0124), 
cystatin C -0.0391 (95% CI -0.0772--0.00107). When using clinical cut-points we 
additionally found associations between LTL and insulin resistance -0.0412 (95% 
CI -0.0685--0.0139), systolic blood pressure 0.0455 (95% CI 0.00137-0.0897), and 
diastolic blood pressure -0.0674 (95% CI -0.126--0.00889). These associations 
were 10%-15% greater without controlling for leukocyte cell types. There were 
very few differences in the associations by age, race/ethnicity, gender, 
education, or income. Our findings are relevant to the relationships between 
these cardiovascular biomarkers in the general population but not to 
cardiovascular disease as a clinical outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: LTL is most strongly associated with adiposity, but is also 
associated with biomarkers across several physiological systems. LTL may thus be 
a predictor of cardiovascular disease through its association with multiple risk 
factors that are physiologically correlated with risk for development of 
cardiovascular disease. Our results are consistent with LTL being a biomarker of 
cardiovascular aging through established physiological mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: Physical activity may protect against health consequences 
associated with obesity, yet less is known on how the duration of obesity alters 
this association, specifically as it relates to leukocyte telomere length.
METHODS: The 1999-2002 NHANES was used to place individuals into 6 mutually 
exclusive groups based on physical activity status and weight status/duration.
RESULTS: All active individuals, except for those overweight/obese for longer 
durations, were associated with longer telomeres in comparison to sedentary 
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may attenuate the decline in telomere length 
associated with obesity, but this protective effect may be negated by prolonged 
periods of overweight/obesity.

SCOPE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an important biomarker of aging. This 
study examined whether inflammatory potential of diet, as measured by the 
Dietary Inflammatory IndexTM (DII) has an impact on telomere shortening in the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We also carried out 
validation of the DII with C-reactive protein (CRP).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data came from NHANES 1999-2002. LTL and CRP were assayed 
from leukocyte DNA and serum specimens, respectively. The DII was calculated 
from food intakes assessed using 24-h dietary recalls and expressed per 1000 
calories consumed. Associations were examined using survey-based multivariable 
linear regression for log-transformed LTL. After multivariable adjustment, 
higher DII scores (i.e. relatively more pro inflammatory) were associated with 
shorter LTL both when used as continuous (b  =  -0.003; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]  =  -0.005, -0.0002) and as quartiles (bDIIquartile4vs1   =  -0.013; 95% 
CI  =  -0.025, -0.001; Ptrend   =  .03). In this same sample the DII also was 
associated with CRP ≥3 mg/L (ORDIIcontinuous = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.16).
CONCLUSION: In these NHANES data there was an association between DII and LTL. 
This study also provided a successful construct validation of the DII using CRP 
in a nationally representative sample. These results are consistent with the 
hypothesis that diet-associated inflammation determines LTL.

PURPOSE: Telomere length is a biomarker of cellular ageing, with longer 
telomeres associated with longevity and reduced risk of chronic disease in older 
age. Consumption of a healthy diet may contribute to longevity via its impact on 
cellular ageing, but studies on diet and telomere length to date have been 
limited and their findings equivocal. The aim of this study was to examine 
associations between three indices of diet quality and telomere length in older 
men and women.
METHODS: Adults aged 57-68 years participating in the Wellbeing, Eating and 
Exercise for a Long Life (WELL) study in Victoria, Australia (n = 679), 
completed a postal survey including an 111-item food frequency questionnaire in 
2012. Diet quality was assessed via three indices: the Dietary Guideline Index, 
the Recommended Food Score, and the Mediterranean Diet Score. Relative telomere 
length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Associations 
between diet quality and telomere length were assessed using linear regression 
adjusted for covariates.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, physical activity, 
and body mass index (BMI), there were no significant associations between diet 
quality and relative telomere length.
CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of older adults residing in Victoria, Australia, men 
and women aged 57-68 years with better-quality diets did not have longer 
telomeres. Further investigation in longitudinal studies will determine whether 
diet can influence telomere length over time in an ageing population.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the association of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
with leukocyte telomere length, which may be altered in preclinical prostate 
malignancies.
METHODS: This study was based on the 2001-2002 U.S. National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A subsample of 1,127 men aged 40-85 years 
without prior history of prostate cancer who provided informed consent and blood 
samples were selected. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) relative to standard DNA 
reference (T/S ratio) was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
Survey-weighted multivariable linear regression was performed to examine T/S 
ratio across quintiles of total and free PSA and free-to-total PSA ratio 
(%fPSA). A sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding men dying from 
prostate cancer during follow-up through to December 31, 2006. Stratification 
analyses were carried out to assess any effect modification by age group, race, 
body mass index (BMI), and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of 
inflammation.
RESULTS: Higher total PSA levels were associated to longer LTL, with 
approximately 8% increase in log-transformed T/S ratio (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 2-13%) among men in the highest quintile of total PSA compared to the 
lowest in the fully adjusted model (Ptrend  = 0.01). No significant association 
was found for free PSA or %fPSA, although nonlinearity between all PSA measures 
and T/S ratio was indicated. Similar results were found after excluding men who 
died from prostate cancer during follow-up. We also found the associations 
between total PSA and T/S ratio to be strongest among non-Hispanic blacks, 
non-obese men (BMI <30 kg/m2 ), and those with low CRP. However, a significant 
interaction was only found between total PSA and race/ethnicity (Pinteraction 
 = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Total PSA levels were strongly associated to LTL, particularly among 
non-Hispanic blacks. Our findings support a potential link between PSA and 
specific mechanisms contributing to prostate cancer development. Prostate

BACKGROUND: Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences (TTAGGG) and their 
associated proteins at the end of eukaryote chromosomes. Telomere length 
shortens throughout the lifespan with each cell division, and leukocyte telomere 
length (LTL) is often used as a biomarker of cellular aging. LTL is related to 
many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, 
to our knowledge, the relation between LTL and risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes, such as dietary intake of processed meat and unprocessed 
red meat, is largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of processed meat intake and unprocessed 
red meat intake with LTL.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 2846 American Indians from the 
Strong Heart Family Study who participated in the 2001-2003 examination. Dietary 
factors, including past-year consumption of processed meat and unprocessed red 
meat, were assessed with the use of a 119-item Block Food-Frequency 
Questionnaire. LTL was measured with the use of quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations 
of intake of processed meat and unprocessed red meat with LTL.
RESULTS: Consumption of processed meat was negatively associated with LTL after 
adjustment for age, sex, site, education, smoking, alcohol use, physical 
activity, and other dietary factors. For every additional daily serving of 
processed meat, LTL was 0.021 units (telomeric product-to-single-copy gene 
ratio) shorter (β ± SE = -0.021 ± 0.008, P = 0.009). No association was observed 
between the intake of unprocessed red meat and LTL (β ± SE = 0.008 ± 0.011, P = 
0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: In the Strong Heart Family Study, consumption of processed meat, 
but not unprocessed red meat, was associated with shorter LTL, a potential 
mediator for several age-related diseases. Further studies are needed to better 
understand the biological mechanism by which processed meat intake influences 
cellular aging.

BACKGROUND: There are few studies on the association between nutrient intake and 
telomere length, which may reflect cumulative oxidative stress and indicate 
biological ageing. In the present study, we evaluated longitudinal associations 
between the consumption of micronutrients, including antioxidant nutrients and B 
vitamins involved in one-carbon transfer pathways, and leukocyte telomere length 
(LTL).
METHODS: The study included 1958 middle-aged and older Korean men and women (age 
range at baseline: 40-69 years) from a population-based cohort. We collected 
dietary information at baseline using a semiquantitative food frequency 
questionnaire (June 2001 to January 2003) and assessed the consumption of 
micronutrients, including vitamins A, B1 , B2 , B3 , B6 , B9 (folate), C and E, 
as well as calcium, phosphorus, potassium, iron and zinc. We measured LTL using 
a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the 10-year follow-up examination 
(February 2011 to November 2012).
RESULTS: In the multiple regression model adjusted for potential confounders, 
LTL was positively associated with the consumption of vitamin C (P < 0.05), 
folate (P = 0.05) and potassium (P = 0.05) in all participants. In the 
age-stratified analysis, the association between the consumption of vitamin C (P 
< 0.01), folate (P < 0.05) and potassium (P < 0.05) with LTL was significant 
only among participants aged <50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the earlier consumption of vitamin C, 
folate and potassium, which are abundant in fruits and vegetables, can delay 
biological ageing in middle-aged and older adults.

Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences (TTAGGG) at the end of chromosomes. Cells 
with critically short telomeres enter replicative senescence and apoptosis. 
Several in vitro studies report that antimony causes cell apoptosis in human 
leukocyte cell lines. The goal of this analysis was to investigate whether there 
is an association between antimony exposure and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) 
among US adults aged 20 and older based on the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. We used multivariate linear regression to 
analyze the association of urinary antimony with LTL. LTL was log-natural 
transformed and the results were re-transformed and presented as percent 
differences. After adjustment for potential confounders, individuals in the 3rd 
and 4th quartiles of urinary antimony had statistically significantly shorter 
LTL (-4.78%, 95% CI: -8.42,-0.90; and -6.11%, 95% CI: -11.04,-1.00, 
respectively) compared to the lowest referent quartile, with evidence of a 
dose-response relationship (p-value for trend =0.03). Shorter LTL with antimony 
was driven by middle aged (40-59 years) and older (60-85 years) adult groups. 
The association may be biologically plausible because of reported oxidative 
stress and apoptosis effects of antimony on blood cells, effects known to 
shorten telomere length.

BACKGROUND: Repeated nucleotide sequences combined with proteins called 
telomeres cover chromosome ends and dictate cells lifespan. Many factors can 
modify telomere length, among them are: nutrition and smoking habits, physical 
activities and socioeconomic status measured by education level. The aim of the 
study was to determine the influence of above mentioned factors on peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells telomere length.
METHODS: Study included 28 subjects (seven male and 21 female, age 
18-65 years.), smokers and non-smokers without any serious health problems in 
past and present. Following a basic medical examination, patients completed the 
food frequency questionnaire with 17 foods and beverages most common groups and 
gave blood for testing. PBMC telomere length were measured with qualitative 
real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) method and expressed as a T/S ratio.
RESULTS: Among nine food types (cereal, fruits, vegetables, diary, red meat, 
poultry, fish, sweets and salty snacks) and eight beverages (juices, coffee, 
tea, mineral water, alcoholic- and sweetened carbonated beverages) only intake 
of red meat was related to T/S ratio. Individuals with increased consumption of 
red meat have had higher T/S ratio and the strongest significant differences 
were observed between consumer groups: "never" and "1-2 daily" (p = 0.02). 
Smoking habits, physical activity, LDL and HDL concentrations, and education 
level were not related to telomere length, directly or as a covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: Unexpected correlation of telomere length with the frequency of 
consumption of red meat indicates the need for further in-depth research and may 
undermine some accepted concepts of adverse effects of this diet on the health 
status and life longevity.

BACKGROUND: Coffee is an important source of antioxidants, and consumption of 
this beverage is associated with many health conditions and a lower mortality 
risk. However, no study, to our knowledge, has examined whether varying coffee 
or caffeine consumption levels are associated with telomere length, a biomarker 
of aging whose shortening can be accelerated by oxidative stress.
OBJECTIVE: We performed a large comprehensive study on how coffee consumption is 
associated with telomere length.
METHODS: We used data from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), a prospective cohort 
study of female nurses that began in 1976. We examined the cross-sectional 
association between coffee consumption and telomere length in 4780 women from 
the NHS. Coffee consumption information was obtained from validated 
food-frequency questionnaires, and relative telomere length was measured in 
peripheral blood leukocytes by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction. Unconditional logistic regression was used to obtain ORs when the 
telomere length outcome was dichotomized at the median. Linear regression was 
used for tests of trend with coffee consumption and telomere length as 
continuous variables.
RESULTS: Higher total coffee consumption was significantly associated with 
longer telomeres after potential confounding adjustment. Compared with 
non-coffee drinkers, multivariable ORs for those drinking 2 to <3 and ≥3 cups of 
coffee/d were, respectively, 1.29 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.68) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.04, 
1.78) (P-trend = 0.02). We found a significant linear association between 
caffeine consumption from all dietary sources and telomere length (P-trend = 
0.02) after adjusting for potential confounders, but not after additionally 
adjusting for total coffee consumption (P-trend = 0.37).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that higher coffee consumption is associated with longer 
telomeres among female nurses. Future studies are needed to better understand 
the influence of coffee consumption on telomeres, which may uncover new 
knowledge of how coffee consumption affects health and longevity.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified the di-2-ethylhexyl 
phthalate (DEHP) as "possibly carcinogenic to humans". In vitro studies reported 
that phthalate exposure resulted in induction of several nuclear transcription 
factors that are activators of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and 
telomerase activity of the human telomerase complex. The objective of this study 
was to determine whether there is an association between urinary phthalate 
metabolites [mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), 
mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP), and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and 
leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in the adult population of the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 (n=2472). After adjustment 
for potential confounders, participants in the 3rd and 4th quartiles of urinary 
MEHP had statistically significantly longer LTL (5.34%, 95% CI: 1.31, 9.53; and 
7.14%, 95% CI: 2.94, 11.63; respectively) compared to the lowest quartile, with 
evidence of a dose-response relationship (p-trend=0.01). The association 
remained when the analyses were stratified by age groups (20-39years, 
40-59years, and 60years and older), and sex. Furthermore, MBP and MBzP were 
associated with higher LTL in older participants. The age independent 
association between longer LTL and MEHP (a metabolite of DEHP) might suggest a 
possible role of MEHP as tumor promoter.

OBJECTIVES: To explore influence of carbohydrates/fat proportions, dietary 
ingredients on telomere length shortening, oxidative stress and inflammation in 
a Chinese population with different glucose tolerance status.
METHODS: Five hundred and fifty-six Chinese subjects without diabetes history 
underwent a 75 g, 2 h Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Subjects with diabetes 
(n = 159), pre-diabetes (n = 197), and normal glucose tolerance (n = 200) were 
screened. Dietary intakes were evaluated using a semi-quantitative food 
frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length (LTL) 
was assessed using a real-time PCR assay. Blood lipid profile, levels of the 
oxidative stress indicators superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase 
(GR), 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) and inflammation indicators tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF-ɑ), interleukine-6 (IL-6) were measured. Levels of HbA1c, 
plasma glucose, insulin, and C peptide were also determined. Measurements were 
taken at 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min after 75 g OGTT. Insulin sensitivity 
was evaluated by HOMA-IR. Basal insulin secretion index (HOMA-β), early phase 
disposition index (DI30) and total phase disposition index (DI120) indicate 
insulin levels at different phases of insulin secretion.
RESULTS: In patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, LTL adjusted by age was 
longer in HbA1c < 7 % group (log (LTL):1.93 ± 0.25) than in HbA1c ≥ 7 % group 
(log (LTL):1.82 ± 0.29). LTL was not associated with daily energy intake, diet 
fat, carbohydrates and protein proportions. Multiple linear regression analysis 
indicated that legumes, nuts, fish and seaweeds were protective factors for LTL 
shortening, and sweetened carbonated beverage was a risk factor for LTL 
shortening ( legumes: β = 0.105, p = 0.018; nuts: β = 0.110, p = 0.011; fish: β 
= 0.118, p = 0.007; seaweeds: β = 0.116, p = 0.009; sweetened carbonated 
beverage: β = -0.120, p = 0.004 ). Daily energy intake was positively associated 
with TNF-ɑ, IL-6 (TNF-ɑ: r = 0.125, p = 0.006;IL-6: r = 0.092, p =0.04). Fat, 
carbohydrate proportions were positively associated with TNF-ɑ (fat: r = 0.119, 
p = 0.008 ; carbohydrate: r = 0.094, p = 0.043). Seaweeds and dairy intake were 
negatively associated with 8-oxo-dG (seaweed: r = -0.496, p = 0.001;dairy: r = 
-0.246, p = 0.046 ), vegetables and fruits were positively associated with GR ( 
vegetables: r = 0.101, p = 0.034;fruits: r = 0.125, p = 0.045). Cereal, meat 
were positively associated with TNF-ɑ ( cereal: r = 0.091, p = 0.048 ; meat: r = 
0.405, p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Diabetes patients with better plasma glucose (HbA1c < 7 %) had 
longer LTL, LTL could reflect plasma glucose status in diabetes patients. LTL 
were probably not influenced by diet carbohydrates/fat proportions but was 
associated with diet ingredients. Diet ingredients significantly impacted on 
markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, which probably had an effect on 
LTL.

BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that environmental exposures and behaviour 
influence telomere length, an indicator of cellular ageing. We systematically 
associated 461 indicators of environmental exposures, physiology and 
self-reported behaviour with telomere length in data from the US National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2002. Further, we tested 
whether factors identified in the NHANES participants are also correlated with 
gene expression of telomere length modifying genes.
METHODS: We correlated 461 environmental exposures, behaviours and clinical 
variables with telomere length, using survey-weighted linear regression, 
adjusting for sex, age, age squared, race/ethnicity, poverty level, education 
and born outside the USA, and estimated the false discovery rate to adjust for 
multiple hypotheses. We conducted a secondary analysis to investigate the 
correlation between identified environmental variables and gene expression 
levels of telomere-associated genes in publicly available gene expression 
samples.
RESULTS: After correlating 461 variables with telomere length, we found 22 
variables significantly associated with telomere length after adjustment for 
multiple hypotheses. Of these varaibales, 14 were associated with longer 
telomeres, including biomarkers of polychlorinated biphenyls([PCBs; 0.1 to 0.2 
standard deviation (SD) increase for 1 SD increase in PCB level, P  < 0.002] and 
a form of vitamin A, retinyl stearate. Eight variables associated with shorter 
telomeres, including biomarkers of cadmium, C-reactive protein and lack of 
physical activity. We could not conclude that PCBs are correlated with gene 
expression of telomere-associated genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Both environmental exposures and chronic disease-related risk 
factors may play a role in telomere length. Our secondary analysis found no 
evidence of association between PCBs/smoking and gene expression of 
telomere-associated genes. All correlations between exposures, behaviours and 
clinical factors and changes in telomere length will require further 
investigation regarding biological influence of exposure.

BACKGROUND: Reproductive health disparities may be partly explained by the 
cumulative effects of chronic stress experienced by socially disadvantaged 
groups. Although, telomere length (TL) and allostatic load score have each been 
used as biological markers of stress, the relationship between these two 
measures is unknown.
METHODS: We investigated the association between leucocyte TL and allostatic 
load score in 1503 non-pregnant women (20-44 years) participating in the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002. We constructed six 
different allostatic load scores using either quartile- or clinical-based 
cut-points for 14 biomarkers based on previously published methods. We estimated 
associations between TL and allostatic load scores and component biomarkers 
using linear regression, also assessing interactions by race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, longer TL was associated with higher HDL 
cholesterol and lower C-reactive protein and creatinine clearance; TL was not 
associated with the other component biomarkers. Shorter TL was associated with 
higher allostatic load scores for the two clinical cut-point-based scores after 
adjustment for age, but not the four scores based on quartile cut-points. 
Significant interactions by race/ethnicity were observed for TL and HbA1c and 
triglycerides, but not for other component biomarkers or allostatic load scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Although TL and allostatic load score are both considered measures 
of cumulative stress, most component biomarkers and scores using quartile-based 
cut-points were not associated with TL. In reproductive-aged women, allostatic 
load scores using clinical-based cut-points were more strongly associated with 
TL compared with quartile-based scores.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) induce the expression of the proto-oncogene 
c-myc which has a role in cellular growth and proliferation programs. The c-myc 
up-regulates the telomerase reverse transcriptase which adds the telomeres 
repeating sequences to the chromosomal ends to compensate for the progressive 
loss of telomeric sequence. We performed multivariate linear regression to 
analyze the association of PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and 
1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran with leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in 
the adult population (n = 2413) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey 1999-2002. LTL was natural log-transformed and the results were 
re-transformed and presented as percent differences. Individuals in the 3rd and 
4th quartiles of the sum of PCBs were associated with 8.33% (95% CI: 4.08-13.88) 
and 11.63% (95% CI: 6.18-17.35) longer LTLs, respectively, compared with the 
lowest quartile, with evidence of a dose-response relationship (p-trend < 0.01). 
The association of the sum PCBs with longer LTL was found in both sexes. 
Additionally, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran and 
1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin were associated with longer LTL. The age 
independent association between longer LTL and environmental exposures to PCBs, 
1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 
may support a role as tumor promoter of these compounds. Further studies to 
evaluate the effect of these compounds on LTL are needed to more fully 
understand the implications of our finding.

PURPOSE: Telomere length is a biomarker for aging. It is known that oxidative 
stress can accelerate telomere shortening, whereas antioxidants can delay their 
shortening. Carotenoids as antioxidants are favorably associated with health- 
and aging-related diseases caused by oxidative stress, but their association 
with telomere length is less certain. We investigated the association between 
blood carotenoid levels and leukocyte telomere length in a representative sample 
of US adults.
METHODS: We analyzed 3660 participants aged 20 years and older in the 1999-2002 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The levels of 
carotenoids-alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans + cis), beta-cryptoxanthin, 
combined lutein/zeaxanthin, and trans-lycopene-were measured using 
high-performance liquid chromatography. The leukocyte telomere length (T/S 
ratio) was assayed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.
RESULTS: A doubling of blood alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans + cis), and 
beta-cryptoxanthin was associated with approximately 2 % longer telomeres. 
Compared with the lowest carotenoid quartile of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene 
(trans + cis), and beta-cryptoxanthin, telomere length for adults with the 
highest quartiles was significantly increased by 5-8 %.
CONCLUSION: We found that increasing levels of blood carotenoid were 
significantly associated with longer leukocyte telomeres in US adults. High 
intake of carotenoid-rich food may play a role in protecting telomeres and 
regulating telomere length.

BACKGROUND: Previous research demonstrates that physical activity participation 
is associated with longer leukocyte telomere length, with shorter leukocyte 
telomere length being a hallmark characteristic of cellular aging. What remains 
under-investigated, however, is whether there is a mode-specific association of 
physical activity on leukocyte telomere length, which was this study's purpose.
METHODS: Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey were used (N=6474 adults analyzed). Leukocyte telomere length was 
assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Physical activity was 
assessed via self-report, with participants classified as meeting physical 
activity guidelines (≥2000 metabolic equivalent of task-min-month) for 9 
separate physical activities, including aerobics (unweighted percent meeting 
guidelines: 2.98%; n=193), basketball (2.0%; n=129), bicycling (3.71%; n=240), 
dance (2.30%; n=149), running (3.09%; n=200), stair climbing (1.33%, n=86), 
swimming (1.85%, n=120), walking (13.53%; n=876), and weight lifting (2.61%; 
n=169).
RESULTS: In a single multivariable linear regression model including the 
independent variables of age, gender, race-ethnicity, weight status, total 
cholesterol, C-reactive protein, total metabolic equivalent of task-min-month of 
physical activity and the 9 binary meeting physical activity guideline 
variables, the only mode of physical activity that was significantly associated 
with leukocyte telomere length was meeting physical activity guidelines from 
running (β=0.06; 95% CI: 0.01-0.11; P=0.03).
CONCLUSION: Running-specific physical activity was the only evaluated physical 
activity associated with leukocyte telomere length, which may provide one 
potential mechanism (i.e., leukocyte telomere length) through which 
running-based physical activity may help to prevent cardiovascular disease and 
premature mortality.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Data on the association between snoring and telomere length, 
an indicator of biological aging, are very limited. Moreover, no polysomnography 
(PSG) studies on this association in a general population have been conducted. 
Our study aimed to evaluate the association between snoring and leukocyte 
telomere length (LTL) using PSG and a questionnaire.
METHODS: A cross-sectional PSG study embedded in a population-based cohort from 
the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study was conducted in 2010-2013. During the same 
period, questionnaire-based interviews, blood collection, and relative LTL 
assays were conducted. A total of 887 Korean men and women aged 50-79 y with an 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 15 determined in the PSG study were included in the 
study.
RESULTS: We observed that the percentage of time spent snoring during sleep (% 
time spent snoring) assessed by PSG was inversely associated with LTL even after 
adjusting for potential risk factors and AHI. In the linear regression 
association between tertiles of percentage of time spent snoring and 
log-transformed LTL, coefficient estimates (P value) were -0.076 (< 0.05) for 
the second tertile and -0.084 (< 0.01) for the third tertile compared with the 
bottom tertile. When LTL was compared according to snoring status determined 
using PSG and questionnaire information, both primary snorers and those with 
mild sleep apnea (5 ≤ AHI < 15) had shorter LTL than nonsnorers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that snoring may influence telomere attrition 
independent of sleep apnea.

OBJECTIVES: Peripheral leucocyte telomere length has been suggested to be 
inversely associated with hypertension risk. Both telomere length and 
hypertension risk can be modified by certain dietary factors, such as fruit and 
vegetables. This study was to examine the potential effect of these dietary 
factors on the association between telomere length and hypertension risk.
STUDY DESIGN: A community-based case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: 271 hypertensive patients and 455 normotensive controls aged 
40-70 years and living in Yinzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Peripheral leucocyte relative telomere length (RTL) was 
measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Dietary intake was assessed by a 
brief semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The association between RTL 
and hypertension risk was analysed using logistic regression, and the modulatory 
effect of dietary intake on RTL-related hypertension risk was analysed using 
likelihood ratio tests.
RESULTS: Among controls, longer age-adjusted RTL was associated with higher 
vegetable intake (p=0.01). Individuals with longer age-adjusted RTL (based on 
median value) were 30% less likely to have hypertension (OR=0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 
0.96; p=0.03). The observed RTL-hypertension relationship appeared to be 
modified by vegetable intake-longer RTL was significantly associated with lower 
hypertension risk only in those with greater vegetable consumption (OR=0.28, 95% 
CI 0.14 to 0.57; p<0.001), but not in those with lower vegetable intake 
(P-interaction=0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Certain dietary factors might modify telomere-related hypertension 
risk.

PURPOSE: Telomeres, DNA-protein structures that cap and protect chromosomes, are 
thought to shorten more rapidly when exposed to chronic inflammation and 
oxidative stress. Diet and nutritional status may be a source of inflammation 
and oxidative stress. However, relationships between telomere length (TL) and 
diet or adiposity have primarily been studied cross-sectionally among older, 
overweight/obese populations and yielded inconsistent results. Little is known 
about the relationship between diet or body composition and TL among younger, 
low- to normal-weight populations. It also remains unclear how cumulative 
exposure to a specific diet or body composition during the years of growth and 
development, when telomere attrition is most rapid, may be related to TL in 
adulthood.
METHODS: In a sample of 1459 young adult Filipinos, we assessed the relationship 
between blood TL at ages 20.8-22.5 and measures of BMI z-score, waist 
circumference, and diet collected between the ages of 8.5 and 22.5. TL was 
measured using monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR, and diet was measured 
using multiple 24-h recalls.
RESULTS: We found no associations between blood TL and any of the measures of 
adiposity or between blood TL and the seven dietary factors examined: processed 
meats, fried/grilled meats and fish, non-fried fish, coconut oil, fruits and 
vegetables, bread and bread products, and sugar-sweetened beverages.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the inconsistencies in the literature and our null 
results, small differences in body composition and consumption of any single 
pro- or anti-inflammatory dietary component may not by themselves have a 
meaningful impact on telomere integrity, or the impact may differ across 
distinct ecological circumstances.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins, 
furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may influence leukocyte telomere 
length (LTL), a biomarker associated with chronic disease. In vitro research 
suggests dioxins may bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and induce 
telomerase activity, which elongates LTL. However, few epidemiologic studies 
have investigated associations between POPs and LTL.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between 18 PCBs, 7 dioxins, and 9 furans 
and LTL among 1,330 U.S. adults from NHANES 2001-2002.
METHODS: We created three summed POP metrics based on toxic equivalency factor 
(TEF), a potency measure including affinity for the AhR: a) non-dioxin-like PCBs 
(composed of 10 non-dioxin-like PCBs; no AhR affinity and no TEF); b) non-ortho 
PCBs (composed of 2 non-ortho-substituted PCBs with high TEFs); and c) toxic 
equivalency (TEQ) (composed of 7 dioxins, 9 furans, 2 non-ortho-substituted 
PCBs, and 6 mono-ortho-substituted PCBs; weighted by TEF). We tested the 
association between each metric and LTL using linear regression, adjusting for 
demographics, blood cell count and distribution, and another metric with a 
different TEF (i.e., non-ortho PCBs and TEQ adjusted for non-dioxin-like PCBs; 
non-dioxin-like PCBs adjusted for non-ortho PCBs).
RESULTS: In adjusted models, each doubling of serum concentrations of non-ortho 
PCBs and TEQ was associated with 3.74% (95% CI: 2.10, 5.40) and 5.29% (95% CI: 
1.66, 9.05) longer LTLs, respectively. Compared with the lowest quartile, the 
highest quartile of exposure was associated with 9.16% (95% CI: 2.96, 15.73) and 
7.84% (95% CI: -0.53, 16.92) longer LTLs, respectively. Non-dioxin-like PCBs 
were not associated with LTL.
CONCLUSIONS: POPs with high TEFs and AhR affinity were associated with longer 
LTL. Because many dioxin-associated cancers are also associated with longer LTL, 
these results may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying PCB- and 
dioxin-related carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the association between telomere length and 
diabetes have been inconsistent, and there are few data available investigating 
the associations of telomere length with diabetes duration and control. We 
evaluated the relationship of leukocyte telomere length with diabetes, and the 
relationship of leukocyte telomere length with diabetes duration and poor 
glucose control among people with diabetes.
METHODS: We used data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey, a representative sample of the US civilian 
non-institutionalized population. In 3921 participants, leukocyte telomere 
length was measured and diabetes status was determined based on a previous 
diagnosis, hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5 %, or fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL.
RESULTS: The odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) of diabetes associated with 
the first, second, and third quartile of leukocyte telomere length, compared to 
the highest quartile, was 2.09 (1.46-2.98), 1.74 (1.30-2.31), and 1.08 
(0.76-1.54), respectively (p-trend < 0.01), in unadjusted models and 0.74 
(0.48-1.14), 0.91 (0.61-1.34), and 0.87 (0.59-1.29), respectively (p-trend = 
0.20), in multivariable adjusted models. Among participants with diabetes, 
unadjusted and adjusted leukocyte telomere length was not associated with 
diabetes duration or glucose control based on an hemoglobin A1c < 7 or < 8 % 
(all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of the US general population, leukocyte telomere 
length was not associated with diabetes status, diabetes duration, or diabetes 
control.

BACKGROUND: Dietary factors can affect telomere length (TL), a biomarker of 
aging, through oxidation and inflammation-related mechanisms. A Dietary 
Inflammatory Index (DII) could help to understand the effect of the inflammatory 
potential of the diet on telomere shortening.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the association of the DII with TL and 
to examine whether diet-associated inflammation could modify the telomere 
attrition rate after a 5-y follow-up of a Mediterranean dietary intervention.
DESIGN: This was a prospective study of 520 participants at high cardiovascular 
disease risk (mean ± SD age: 67.0 ± 6.0 y, 45% males) from the PREDIMED-NAVARRA 
(PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea-NAVARRA) trial. Leukocyte TL was measured by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction at baseline and after 5 y of 
follow-up. The DII was calculated from self-reported data by using a validated 
137-item food-frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: Longer telomeres at baseline were found in participants who had a more 
anti-inflammatory diet (lowest DII score) (P-trend = 0.012). Longitudinal 
analyses further showed that a greater anti-inflammatory potential of the diet 
(i.e., a decrease in the DII) could significantly slow down the rate of telomere 
shortening. Moreover, the multivariable-adjusted OR for short telomeres (z score 
≤20th percentile) was 1.80 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.17) in a comparison between the 
highest (proinflammatory) and the lowest (anti-inflammatory) DII tertiles. 
Similarly, a greater DII (greatest proinflammatory values) after a 5-y follow-up 
was associated with almost a 2-fold higher risk of accelerated telomere 
attrition compared with the highest decrease in DII (greatest anti-inflammatory 
values) during this period (P-trend = 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed both cross-sectional and longitudinal 
associations between the inflammatory potential of the diet and telomere 
shortening in subjects with a high cardiovascular disease risk. Our findings are 
consistent with, but do not show, a beneficial effect of adherence to an 
anti-inflammatory diet on aging and health by slowing down telomere shortening. 
These results suggest that diet might play a key role as a determinant of TL 
through proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms. This trial was 
registered at controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN35739639.

Lower Extremity Muscular Strength and Leukocyte Telomere Length: Implications of 
Muscular Strength in Attenuating Age-Related Chronic Disease.

(1)Dept of Health, Exercise Science, and Recreation Management, University of 
Mississippi, University, MS.

OBJECTIVE: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) shortening is characteristic of aging 
and is associated with morbidity and mortality, independent of age. Research 
demonstrates that lower extremity muscular strength is associated with mobility, 
morbidity and mortality; however, no study, to our knowledge, had examined the 
association between lower extremity muscular strength and LTL, which was the 
purpose of this brief study.
METHODS: Data from the 1999-2002 NHANES was used (N = 2410; 50-85 years). Peak 
isokinetic knee extensor strength (IKES) was objectively measured with LTL 
assessed from a blood sample.
RESULTS: After adjustments, for every 50 N increase in IKES, participants had a 
9% reduced odds (P = .04) of being in the 1st (vs. 4th) LTL quartile.
DISCUSSION: Lower extremity muscular strength is associated with LTL, suggesting 
a possible mechanism through which lower extremity muscular strength may be 
associated with morbidity and mortality.

OBJECTIVES: Age-at-menopause and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) are both 
associated with biologic aging. Therefore, it would be reasonable to hypothesize 
that LTL may also serve as a marker for reproductive aging as shorter LTL may be 
associated with earlier age-at-menopause.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 799 post-menopausal (ages 41-85) participants in 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002), a nationally 
representative sample of U.S. women.
RESULTS: Controlling for behavioral, socio-demographic, and health-related 
determinants of menopause, we found that among non-Hispanic white women, an 
increase of one standard deviation in LTL was associated with a 0.43 year higher 
reported age-at-menopause. Among Mexican-Americans, an increase of one standard 
deviation in LTL was associated with a 1.56 year earlier menopause. There was no 
significant association between LTL and age-at-menopause among non-Hispanic 
black women.
CONCLUSIONS: Our main finding is evidence of a strong interaction by 
race/ethnicity in the association between LTL and age-at-menopause. This 
evidence does not support the hypothesis that shorter LTL is a predictor of 
earlier age-at-menopause, as the magnitude and direction of the associations 
between LTL and age-at-menopause varied across racial/ethnic groups.

BACKGROUND: This study examined the association between leukocyte telomere 
length--a marker of cell aging--and mortality in a nationally representative 
sample of US adults ages 50-84 years. We also examined moderating effects of 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education.
METHODS: Data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 
1999-2002 (n = 3,091). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate 
the risk of all-cause and cause- specific mortality adjusting for 
sociodemographic characteristics, smoking, body mass index, and chronic 
conditions.
RESULTS: Eight hundred and seventy deaths occurred over an average of 9.5 years 
of follow-up. In the full sample, a decrease of 1 kilobase pair in telomere 
length at baseline was marginally associated with a 10% increased hazard of 
all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9, 
1.4) and a 30% increased hazard of death due to diseases other than 
cardiovascular disease or cancer (HR: 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.9). Among 
African-American but not white or Mexican-American respondents, a decrease of 1 
kilobase pair in telomere length at baseline was associated with a two-fold 
increased hazard of cardiovascular mortality (HR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.1). There 
was no association between telomere length and cancer mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between leukocyte telomere length and mortality 
differs by race/ethnicity and cause of death.

INTRODUCTION: Short leukocyte telomere length (LTL) has become a hallmark 
characteristic of aging. Some, but not all, evidence suggests that physical 
activity (PA) may play an important role in attenuating age-related diseases and 
may provide a protective effect for telomeres. The purpose of this study was to 
examine the association between PA and LTL in a national sample of US adults 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
METHODS: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 1999 to 2002 
(n = 6503; 20-84 yr) were used. Four self-report questions related to 
movement-based behaviors (MBB) were assessed. The four MBB included whether 
individuals participated in moderate-intensity PA, vigorous-intensity PA, 
walking/cycling for transportation, and muscle-strengthening activities. An MBB 
index variable was created by summing the number of MBB an individual engaged in 
(range, 0-4).
RESULTS: A clear dose-response relation was observed between MBB and LTL; across 
the LTL tertiles, respectively, the mean numbers of MBB were 1.18, 1.44, and 
1.54 (Ptrend < 0.001). After adjustments (including age) and compared with those 
engaging in 0 MBB, those engaging in 1, 2, 3, and 4 MBB, respectively, had a 3% 
(P = 0.84), 24% (P = 0.02), 29% (P = 0.04), and 52% (P = 0.004) reduced odds of 
being in the lowest (vs highest) tertile of LTL; MBB was not associated with 
being in the middle (vs highest) tertile of LTL.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater engagement in MBB was associated with reduced odds of being 
in the lowest LTL tertile.

The field of sedentary behavior epidemiology is emerging. Short leukocyte 
telomere length (LTL) is a hallmark characteristic of aging, but LTL is also 
associated with morbidity and mortality independent of age. To my knowledge, 
only one study has examined the association between sedentary behavior and LTL. 
The purpose of this study was to examine the association between screen-based 
sedentary behavior and LTL. Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey were used (N=6405; age, 20-84 years). Leisure-time 
screen-based sedentary behavior (television, video games, computer use) was 
assessed via questionnaire, and LTL was extracted from DNA in whole blood with 
the LTL assay performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. After 
adjustments (including age and physical activity), for every 1-hour increase in 
leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior, participants had a 7% increased 
odds (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00-1.13; P=.04) of having LTL in the lowest 
tertile (vs highest); leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior was not 
associated with values in the middle (vs highest) tertile (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% 
CI, 0.95-1.07; P=.62). The results of this study revealed that greater 
leisure-time screen-based sedentary behavior is associated with shorter LTL.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There are limited data on the association between dietary 
information and leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which is considered an 
indicator of biological aging. In this study, we aimed at determining the 
association between dietary patterns or consumption of specific foods and LTL in 
Korean adults.
SUBJECT/METHODS: A total of 1958 middle-aged and older Korean adults from a 
population-based cohort were included in the study. Dietary data were collected 
from a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline (June 2001 to 
January 2003). LTL was assessed using real-time PCR during the 10-year follow-up 
period (February 2011 to November 2012).
RESULTS: We identified two major factors and generated factor scores using 
factor analysis. The first factor labeled 'prudent dietary pattern' was 
characterized by high intake of whole grains, seafood, legumes, vegetables and 
seaweed, whereas the second factor labeled 'Western dietary pattern' was 
characterized by high intake of refined grain, red meat or processed meat and 
sweetened carbonated beverages. In a multiple linear regression model adjusted 
for age, sex, body mass index and other potential confounding variables, the 
prudent dietary pattern was positively associated with LTL. In the analysis of 
particular food items, higher consumption of legumes, nuts, seaweed, fruits and 
dairy products and lower consumption of red meat or processed meat and sweetened 
carbonated beverages were associated with longer LTL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diet in the remote past, that is, 10 
years earlier, may affect the degree of biological aging in middle-aged and 
older adults.

OBJECTIVE: Telomeres are long hexamer (TTAGGG) repeats at the ends of 
chromosomes, and contribute to maintenance of chromosomal stability. Telomere 
shortening has been linked to cancers and other chronic diseases in adults, 
although evidence for causal associations is limited. The aim of this study was 
to determine whether nutritional factors are associated with telomere length 
(TL) in children.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of nutritional factors and TL in 
437 children between 2009 and 2011. Healthy children ages 3, 6, and 9 y provided 
blood samples, and their parents completed a food frequency questionnaire and a 
telephone interview about relevant environmental exposures. TL and blood 
micronutrient levels were measured, and genotyping at 10 loci was undertaken. 
Associations between the micronutrients and other variables were assessed using 
linear regression.
RESULTS: No significant main or interactive effects of age or sex were seen. 
After adjustment for age, sex, parental education, and month of blood 
collection, TL was inversely associated with plasma zinc, and shorter in 
children with the homozygous mutant genotype of the RFC G80A (rs1051266) 
polymorphism.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of 
the association between telomere length and micronutrients in healthy children. 
The reason for the inverse relationship of TL with zinc is unknown but could be 
the result of an increase in telomere sequence deletions caused by labile zinc 
induction of oxidative stress. These findings should be corroborated in other 
studies before nutritional recommendations might be considered.

Associations of cadmium and lead exposure with leukocyte telomere length: 
findings from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002.

Zota AR, Needham BL, Blackburn EH, Lin J, Park SK, Rehkopf DH, Epel ES.

Cadmium and lead are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that might increase 
risks of cardiovascular disease and other aging-related diseases, but their 
relationships with leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a marker of cellular aging, 
are poorly understood. In experimental studies, they have been shown to induce 
telomere shortening, but no epidemiologic study to date has examined their 
associations with LTL in the general population. We examined associations of 
blood lead and cadmium (n = 6,796) and urine cadmium (n = 2,093) levels with LTL 
among a nationally representative sample of US adults from the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002). The study population geometric 
mean concentrations were 1.67 µg/dL (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63, 1.70) 
for blood lead, 0.44 µg/L (95% CI: 0.42, 0.47) for blood cadmium, and 0.28 µg/L 
(95% CI: 0.27, 0.30) for urine cadmium. After adjustment for potential 
confounders, the highest (versus lowest) quartiles of blood and urine cadmium 
were associated with -5.54% (95% CI: -8.70, -2.37) and -4.50% (95% CI: -8.79, 
-0.20) shorter LTLs, respectively, with evidence of dose-response relationship 
(P for trend < 0.05). There was no association between blood lead concentration 
and LTL. These findings provide further evidence of physiological impacts of 
cadmium at environmental levels and might provide insight into biological 
pathways underlying cadmium toxicity and chronic disease risks.

OBJECTIVES: We tested whether leukocyte telomere length maintenance, which 
underlies healthy cellular aging, provides a link between sugar-sweetened 
beverage (SSB) consumption and the risk of cardiometabolic disease.
METHODS: We examined cross-sectional associations between the consumption of 
SSBs, diet soda, and fruit juice and telomere length in a nationally 
representative sample of healthy adults. The study population included 5309 US 
adults, aged 20 to 65 years, with no history of diabetes or cardiovascular 
disease, from the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys. Leukocyte telomere length was assayed from DNA specimens. Diet was 
assessed using 24-hour dietary recalls. Associations were examined using 
multivariate linear regression for the outcome of log-transformed telomere 
length.
RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related 
characteristics, sugar-sweetened soda consumption was associated with shorter 
telomeres (b = -0.010; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.020, -0.001; P = .04). 
Consumption of 100% fruit juice was marginally associated with longer telomeres 
(b = 0.016; 95% CI = -0.000, 0.033; P = .05). No significant associations were 
observed between consumption of diet sodas or noncarbonated SSBs and telomere 
length.
CONCLUSIONS: Regular consumption of sugar-sweetened sodas might influence 
metabolic disease development through accelerated cell aging.

Telomere length has been hypothesized to be a marker of cumulative exposure to 
stress, and stress is an established cause of depression and anxiety disorders. 
The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between depression, 
anxiety and telomere length, and to assess whether this relationship is 
moderated by race/ethnicity, gender and/or antidepressant use. Data were from 
the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Telomere length 
was assessed using the quantitative PCR method of telomere length relative to 
standard reference DNA. Past-year major depression (MD), generalized anxiety 
disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD), as well as depressed affect and anxious 
affect, were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Inventory 
(N=1290). Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship between 
depression and anxiety disorders and telomere length. Among women, those with 
GAD or PD had shorter telomeres than those with no anxious affect (β: -0.07, 
P<0.01), but there was no relationship among men (β: 0.08, P>0.05). Among 
respondents currently taking an antidepressant, those with MD had shorter 
telomeres than those without (β: -0.26, P<0.05), but there was no association 
between MD and telomere length among those not using antidepressants (β: -0.00, 
P>0.05). Neither depressive nor anxiety disorders were directly associated with 
telomere length in young adults. There was suggestive evidence that 
pharmacologically treated MD is associated with shorter telomere length, likely 
reflecting the more severe nature of MD that has come to clinical attention.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Oxidative stress and inflammation seem to be potential 
underlying mechanisms for telomere attrition. A lack of specific antioxidants is 
believed to increase free radical damage and a greater risk for telomere 
shortening. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between diet and leukocyte 
telomere length in a cross-sectional study of children and adolescents. We 
hypothesized that dietary total antioxidant capacity would be positively 
associated with telomere length.
METHODS: Telomere length was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction in 287 participants (55% males, 6-18 years), who were randomly selected 
from the GENOI study.
RESULTS: A positive correlation between dietary total antioxidant capacity and 
telomere length (r = 0.157, p = 0.007) was found after adjustment for age and 
energy intake. However, higher white bread consumption was associated with 
shorter telomeres (β = -0.204, p = 0.002) in fully-adjusted models. 
Interestingly, those individuals who had simultaneously higher dietary total 
antioxidant capacity and lower white bread consumption significantly presented 
the longest telomeres. Moreover, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for very 
short telomeres was 0.30 for dietary total antioxidant capacity (p = 0.023) and 
1.37 for white bread (p = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that longer telomeres were associated with higher 
dietary total antioxidant capacity and lower white bread consumption in Spanish 
children and adolescents. These findings might open a new line of investigation 
about the potential role of an antioxidant diet in maintaining telomere length.

Dietary factors, including dietary fat, may affect the biological aging process, 
as reflected by the shortening of telomere length (TL), by affecting levels of 
oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. We examined the direct relations of 
total and types of dietary fats and fat-rich foods to peripheral leukocyte TL. 
In 4029 apparently healthy postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's 
Health Initiative, intakes of total fat, individual fatty acids, and fat-rich 
foods were assessed by a questionnaire. TL was measured by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction. Intake of short-to-medium-chain saturated fatty acids 
(SMSFAs; aliphatic tails of ≤ 12 carbons) was inversely associated with TL. 
Compared with participants in other quartiles of SMSFA intake, women who were in 
the highest quartile (median: 1.29% of energy) had shorter TLs [mean: 4.00 kb 
(95% CI: 3.89, 4.11 kb)], whereas women in the lowest quartile of intake 
(median: 0.29% of energy) had longer TLs [mean: 4.13 kb (95% CI: 4.03, 4.24 kb); 
P-trend = 0.046]. Except for lauric acid, all other individual SMSFAs were 
inversely associated with TL (P < 0.05). In isoenergetic substitution models, 
the substitution of 1% of energy from SMSFAs with any other energy source was 
associated with 119 bp longer TLs (95% CI: 21, 216 bp). Intakes of nonskim milk, 
butter, and whole-milk cheese (major sources of SMSFAs) were all inversely 
associated with TL. No significant associations were found with long-chain 
saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids. In conclusion, we found that higher intakes of SMSFAs and SMSFA-rich 
foods were associated with shorter peripheral leukocyte TL among postmenopausal 
women. These findings suggest the potential roles of SMSFAs in the rate of 
biological aging.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between socioeconomic 
status (SES) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) - a marker of cell aging that 
has been linked to stressful life circumstances - in a nationally 
representative, socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample of US adults 
aged 20-84. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES), 1999-2002, we found that respondents who completed less than a high 
school education had significantly shorter telomeres than those who graduated 
from college. Income was not associated with LTL. African-Americans had 
significantly longer telomeres than whites, but there were no significant 
racial/ethnic differences in the association between education and telomere 
length. Finally, we found that the association between education and LTL was 
partially mediated by smoking and body mass index but not by drinking or 
sedentary behavior.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated 
with several chronic diseases, but only a few studies have assessed the 
association between dietary factors and LTL. Our objective was to study the 
association between fats, fruits, vegetables and LTL in a cross-sectional study 
design. We hypothesized that intakes of fruits and vegetables would be 
positively associated with LTL and that intakes of fats, and especially 
saturated fatty acids (SFAs), would be negatively associated with LTL.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: LTL was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction in 1942 men and women aged 57-70 years from the Helsinki Birth Cohort 
Study. We assessed the whole diet by a validated semiquantitative 128-item 
food-frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: In general, there were only a few significant results. However, total 
fat and SFA intake (P=0.04 and 0.01, respectively) were inversely associated 
with LTL in men adjusting for age and energy intake. In women, vegetable intake 
was positively associated with LTL (P=0.05). Men consuming the most butter and 
least fruits had significantly shorter telomeres than those consuming the lowest 
amounts of butter and highest amounts of fruits (P=0.05). We found no 
association between LTL and body mass index, waist-hip ratio, smoking, physical 
activity or educational attainment.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of elderly men and women, there were 
only a few statistically significant effects of diet, but in general they 
support the hypothesis that fat and vegetable intakes were associated with LTL.

BACKGROUND: Dietary energy restriction in mammals, particularly at a young age, 
extends the life span. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is thought to be a 
bioindicator of aging in humans. High n-6 (omega-6) PUFA intake may accelerate 
LTL attrition.
OBJECTIVE: We determined whether lower energy and higher PUFA intakes in young 
adulthood are associated with shorter LTL in cross-sectional and longitudinal 
analyses.
DESIGN: In a longitudinal observational study (405 men, 204 women), diet was 
determined at baseline by a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire, and 
LTL was determined by Southern blots at mean ages of 30.1 y (baseline) and 43.2 
y (follow-up). Spearman correlations and multivariable linear regression were 
used.
RESULTS: Baseline energy intake was inversely associated with follow-up LTL in 
men (standardized β = -0.171, P = 0.0005) but not in women (P = 0.039 for sex 
interaction). The difference in men between the highest and lowest quintiles of 
energy was 244 base pairs (bp) (95% CI: 59, 429 bp) and between extreme 
quintiles of LTL was 440 kcal (95% CI: 180, 700 kcal). Multivariable adjustment 
modestly attenuated the association (β = -0.157, P = 0.002). Inverse 
associations, which were noted for all macronutrients, were strongest for the 
unsaturated fatty acids. In multivariable models including energy and the 
macronutrients (as percentage of energy), the significant inverse energy-LTL 
association (but not the PUFA-LTL association) persisted. The energy-LTL 
association was restricted to never smokers (standardized β = -0.259, P = 
0.0008; P = 0.050 for the smoking × calorie interaction).
CONCLUSIONS: The inverse calorie intake-LTL association is consistent with trial 
data showing beneficial effects of calorie restriction on aging biomarkers. 
Further exploration of energy intake and LTL dynamics in the young is needed.

BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length is associated with diseases of aging, but 
there is limited knowledge of diet and lifestyle determinants.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine cross-sectionally the association 
between diet, body composition, and lifestyle factors on leukocyte telomere 
length in women.
DESIGN: Leukocyte telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction in 2284 female participants from the Nurses' Health Study, who were 
selected as controls for an investigation of biological predictors of cancer. 
Diet, lifestyle, and anthropometric data were assessed by questionnaire.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, dietary fiber intake was positively 
associated with telomere length (z score), specifically cereal fiber, with an 
increase of 0.19 units between the lowest and highest quintiles (P = 0.007, P 
for trend = 0.03). Although total fat intake was not associated with telomere 
length, polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (-0.26 units, quintile 5 compared with 
quintile 1: P = 0.002, P for trend = 0.02), specifically linoleic acid intake, 
was inversely associated with telomere length after multivariate adjustment 
(-0.32 units; P = 0.001, P for trend = 0.05). Waist circumference was inversely 
associated with telomere length [0.15-unit difference in z score in a comparison 
of the highest (> or = 32 in, 81.28 cm) with the lowest (< or = 28 in, 71.12 cm) 
category (P = 0.01, P for trend = 0.02) in the multivariate model]. We found no 
association between telomere length and smoking, physical activity, or 
postmenopausal hormone use.
CONCLUSION: Although the strength of the associations was modest in this 
population of middle- and older-age women, our results support the hypothesis 
that body composition and dietary factors are related to leukocyte telomere 
length, which is a potential biomarker of chronic disease risk.
