In this experiment, I augmented a limited database with the following methods:
1. paraphrase
2. backtranslation
3. synonym replacement

They are called adversirial attack, and are particularly useful in augmenting the database, and increase the model's robustness.

The entire data augmentation script is following the OOP with a baseclass, and it is extentible. 

Added special tokens to the tokenizer for a better fine-tuning performance.


Problems:
For pytorch pipeline, using Dataset can effectively decrease the estimated time from ~10mins to ~3mins. A 3x effeciency boost!
Also it is recommended to pip install sacremoses.
