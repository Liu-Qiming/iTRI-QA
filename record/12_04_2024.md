Today, I updated the project to the new database. This new database consists of the following headers: question, answer, pmid, abstract.
Mao updated the .j2 template so that we can ask the model to generate a set of QA based on the abstract we gave.
In the main.py, I updated the loop to read in from the database, and only feed the model with the abstract using one-shot prompting. 
The result is as expected. The model generates sets of questions based on the abstract conservatively. Note that this model is not fine-tuned. 
Below is the output:

Answer: Question: What is the significance of telomer length in relation to mortality due to influenza or pneumonia?
Answer: Telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomers, has been shown to be reduced in patients with influenza infection. In addition, shorter telomor lengths have been linked to higher mortality rates in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of inflammation and oxidative stress caused by viral infections on telormer length and its implications for

Answer: Question: What is the significance of telomer length in relation to mortality due to influenza or pneumonia?
Answer: Shorter telomers have been linked to increased mortality from respiratory diseases, such as flu and pneumonias. In this study, researchers found that individuals with shorter telmers had a higher risk for these types of deaths, even after adjusting for other factors like age, gender, smoking status, etc. It suggests that telmer length could be used as an indicator for predicting who might be

Answer: Question: What are the potential mechanisms underlying the association between neighborhood green spaces and leukocytes telomerelength?
Answer: The authors suggested that neighborhood greeneries may have a protective role in cellular senescence by reducing stressors like noise, traffic pollution, etc. Additionally, they proposed that social interactions and physical activity within green areas might also contribute to this association. Further studies are needed to investigate these mechanisms in more detail.

Answer: Question: What is the role of neighborhood green spaces in modulating the association between air quality and biological markers of aging?
Answer: The current study suggests that neighborhood greeneries may play a protective role in mitigating the negative effects caused by air pollutants on biological age markers. By providing a natural environment that promotes physical activity and mental well-being, greenspacing may help individuals cope with stressors related to poor air conditions. Additionally, it has been shown that greenscaping can reduce exposure levels

Answer: Question: What is the association of telomer length with fractures?
Answer: Fractures are common in older adults and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have shown that bone health is closely related to fracture risk, which is affected by many factors such as age, gender, genetics, lifestyle, nutrition, etc. Recently, researchers have begun to pay attention to the role of epigenetic factors in bone metabolism. Among them, telomers are known to play an important role

Answer: Question: What is the association of telomer length with fractures?
Answer: In the present study, we found that telomers were positively associated to bone mass and negatively related to fat mass. Moreover, there was a positive association with wrist fracture and a negative one with spine fracture. These results suggest a possible role of teleromers in bone health and fracture risk.

Answer: Question: What is the mechanism behind the association between environmental pollution and Telomeres?
Answer: The study found that Telomer length was significantly correlated with environmental exposures such as polycylic aromatic compounds, heavy metals, etc., which can lead to oxidative stress and DNA damage. These exposures can also alter the expression of genes related to telomer maintenance and repair, leading to shorter telomers. In addition, it was also shown that certain pollutants can directly damage telometers, causing them to shorten

Answer: Question: What is the mechanism behind the association between environmental pollution and Telomerase activity?
Answer: The study suggests that telomerase activity may play a role in regulating the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and inflammation, which are known to contribute to the development of metabolic disorders. Additionally, it has been shown that oxidative damage to DNA can lead to premature aging and cellular senescence, both of which have been linked to metabolic diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which environmental toxins affect

Answer: Question: What is the association between leukocytes telomer length and mortality among patients diagnosed with diabetes?

Answer: Patients with longer telomers had a lower risk for all cause mortality compared to those with shorter teloms. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between cancer related mortality and telome length.

Answer: Question: What is the association between Vitamin C consumption and Telomerase length?
Answer: In this cross sectional study, it was found that higher intake of vitamin c was significantly associated
with longer TEL in both genders. It was concluded that Vitamin c intake may play an important role in maintaining
the length of telomer in humans.
